Hook all transactions?
	register callbacks for TMCB_REQUEST_IN_N & TMCB_RESPONSE_IN_N
	if Call-Info header not found, pass
	might be able to dispense with sca_handle_subscribe().
	performance penalty: cost of check for Call-Info on each transaction.

    OR

check for Call-Info header in script, call "sca_call_info_update"
	must be done in onreply route, too
	more prone to bugs because of missed cases
	easy to misconfigure, potentially leading to low adoption


To consider:
    * What to do when a subscriber reSUBSCRIBES and the dialog is different
      from the current saved subscription? Avoiding shm_realloc seems like a
      good idea, so perhaps just delete the current one and save the new.

      Update: separate shm_alloc for dialog.id in sca_subscription_create,
	      then shm_free & shm_alloc if differing dialog found.


How to remove Call-Info header before relaying?
    Use del_lump from ../../data_lump.h	
    Cf. textops module's remove_hf_f()

How to detect hold/pickup in SDP?
    Use parse_sdp/free_sdp from ../../parser/sdp/sdp.h.
    
	sdp_stream_cell_t	*sdp_stream;
	
	/* puts sdp_info_t pointer in msg->body */
	rc = parse_sdp( msg );
	if ( rc < 0 ) {
	    error;
	}
	/* msg->body must now be free_sdp'd */

	/* for now we'll just assume a single stream per call */
	sdp_stream = get_sdp_stream( msg, 0, 0 );

	if ( sdp->is_on_hold ) {
	    ....
	}
	
		

Call-Info meaning in context
    If present, refers to appearance associated with the Contact URI.

    e.g., a Call-Info header present in an INVITE indicates the caller
    has appearance-index N and is using the line to place a call.

    e.g., a Call-Info header present in a response indicates the callee
    has appearance-index N



A reINVITE from another line in the SCA group has the following characteristics:
    * RURI is the SCA line's AoR, not the callee.
    * From and To URIs are also SCA line's AoR.
	    * SCA provides very limited way to pass callee info: only
	      in NOTIFY's appearance-uri, which is for display purposes.
    * From-tag and Call-ID are new. There is no to-tag.
    * A Call-Info header is present with the appearance-index the line is
      attempting to retrieve from hold.


Revisiting possibility of using TMCB_ tm module hooks.
    TMCB_E2EACK_IN is called when an ACK matching a 200OK-answered INVITE
    is received. Could use this to send out call-info NOTIFYs when an SCA
    line answers a call. Bug right now is that the NOTIFYs are sent out
    before the proxy has CANCELed the INVITEs to the other members of the
    group. Seems the handsets are dumping the line state when they get the
    CANCELs, so the appearance goes away. On next reSUBSCRIBE/NOTIFY, the
    handsets get the correct state again.

    Using TCMB_REQ_IN is a viable option. It would allow for eliminating
    the use of exported functions to the script. Second rev? Probably
    more efficient than using exported functions.

    Hooking TMCB_E2EACK_IN does solve the above problem. Current problem
    is getting current URIs on both call legs, since callee in hold/pickup
    scenario (SCA line A1 holds call to B, SCA line A2 picks up) thinks
    To & From URI are both the SCA line's AoR. Tried sending UPDATEs from
    the TMCB_E2EACK_IN callback, but because we're sending them before the
    proxy relays the ACK to the callee, the callee appears to revert to
    using the URIs in the ACK for all future packets. The callER handles
    the UPDATE correctly, and uses the correct URIs.

    Possible workarounds for the above, in order of increasing quality:
    	* Append UPDATE info to shared linked list, register short timer,
	  send all pending UPDATEs when timer alarms, clear queue.

	    Pros: easy to write, discrete from other code
	    Cons: This is effectively a sleep(1) workaround. Clumsy, prone
		    to error: still might cause UPDATE packet to be sent prior
		    to ACK delivery to callee, if UPDATE is appended to queue
		    just as timer fires.	

	* Register a TMCB_DESTROY callback in the TMCB_E2EACK_IN callback
	  to send the UPDATEs when the ACK transaction is destroyed.
	    
	    Pros: fits current model fairly well, can glean all required
		  information from struct cell in callback, no need to
		  involve script.
	    Cons: also similar to a sleep(1) workaround, though less prone
		  to races. still attached to a timer (tm destroy tick),
		  meaning users may still trigger problem with rapid hold/
		  pickups.

	* Register a pv in the module, set it to a known value in the
	  TMCB_E2EACK_IN callback, have the script check the value of the
	  pv, and invoke an exported sca_update function if the pv is set
	  the the known value.

	    Pros: fits sip-router script-based logic model well, does not
		  rely on a timer (eliminates races).
	    Cons: pv has a lot of overhead for what amounts to a flag, means
		  adding an exported function to the script.

	* Register a flag, set it in TMCB_E2EACK_IN callback if UPDATEs
	  need to go to call legs, invoke sca_update from script as above.

	    Pros: it's just a flag.
	    Cons: setup may be complicated, given sip-router's script flag
		  handling, means adding exported function for script.
		  (see fix_flags in flags.c, e.g. registrar's
		  fix_nated_contact())


Dependency on To-URI is problematic for hold/pickup
    An SCA pickup of a held call on another handset means RURI, From-URI
    and To-URI are identical. The module currently expects those to
    be unique. It will be possible to reconcile these, but it suggests
    that using the sip_uri_t struct and the parse_uri functions may be
    helpful.

No handler for t_reply (locally sent transaction-stateful replies).
    Probably need to register callback for TMCB_LOCAL_RESPONSE_IN.

Deletion of call-info subscription when line-seize NOTIFY fails seems
wrongheaded.
