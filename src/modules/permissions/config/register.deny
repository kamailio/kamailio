# Suppose that we have a PSTN gateway with IP address 1.2.3.4
# We should prevent REGISTER messages that contain that IP
# address in Contact header field because that can cause serious
# security hole (a malicious user might be able to register such
# a contact and bypass security checks performed by the SIP proxy).
#
# The following line prevents registering Contacts with IP 1.2.3.4

ALL : "^sip:.*1\.2\.3\.4$"

# This can be bypassed by the insertion of one or more '0' in the
# IP address. To prevent this the following line could be used.
#
#ALL : "^sip:.*0*1\.0*2\.0*3\.0*4"

# Don't forget to list also all hostnames that can be used to
# reach the PSTN gateway. Please keep in mind that this don't
# provide a perfect security, as everybody can register arbitrary
# domains that point to any IP. To prevent this the usage of hostnames
# and domains in the Contact header field should be avoided.
# A better solution to this problem is the usage of the dst_blocklist
# feature in the openser core. All "critical" IPs should be added to
# this list.
