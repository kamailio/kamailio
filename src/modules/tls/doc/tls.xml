		<title>Overview</title>
		<para>
			This module implements the TLS transport for &kamailio;
			using the <ulink url="http://www.openssl.org">OpenSSL library</ulink>
			(http://www.openssl.org). To enable the &kamailio; TLS support this
			module must be loaded and <emphasis>enable_tls=yes</emphasis> core setting
			must be added to the Kamailio config file.
		</para>
		<para>
			IMPORTANT: the tls module must be loaded before any other &kamailio; module
			that uses libssl (OpenSSL library). A safe option is to have the tls module
			loaded first (be in the first "loadmodule" in &kamailio;.cfg).
		</para>
		<para>
			IMPORTANT: using this module compiled with newer versions of libssl
			(e.g., v1.1+) may require &kamailio; to be started with
			<emphasis>--atexit=no</emphasis> command line parameters to avoid
			calling C atexit callbacks inside the process ending during
			daemonize procedure as well as during shut down, which can lead
			to crashes because it destroys and then accesses shared memory. For
			example, such case has been reported for Ubuntu 20.04 or RedHat 8.
		</para>

	<section id="tls.quick_start">
		<title>Quick Start</title>
		<para>
		The default kamailio.cfg file has basic tls support included, it has to
		be enabled with "#!define WITH_TLS" directive.

		<title>Important Notes</title>
		<para>
			The TLS module needs some special options enabled when compiling
			Kamailio. These options are enabled by default, however in case
			you're using a modified Kamailio version or Makefile, make sure
			that you enable -DUSE_TLS and -DTLS_HOOKS (or compile with make
			TLS_HOOKS=1 which will take care of both options).
		</para>
		<para>
			To quickly check if your Kamailio version was compiled with these
			options, run kamailio -V and look for USE_TLS and TLS_HOOKS among the flags.
		</para>
		<para>
			For OpenSSL (libssl) v1.1.x, it is required to preload
			'openssl_mutex_shared' library shipped by &kamailio;. For more details
			see 'src/modules/tls/utils/openssl_mutex_shared/README.md'.
		</para>
		<para>
			This module includes several workarounds for various Openssl bugs
			(like compression and Kerberos using the wrong memory allocations
			functions, low memory problems a.s.o). On startup it will try to enable 
			the needed workarounds based on the OpenSSL library version. Each time
			a known problem is detected and a workaround is enabled, a message will
			be logged. In general it is recommended to compile this module on the
			same machine or a similar machine to where kamailio will be run or to
			link it statically with <emphasis>libssl</emphasis>. For example if on
			the compile machine OpenSSL does not have the Kerberos support enabled,
			but on the target machine a Kerberos enabled OpenSSL library is installed,
			Kamailio cannot apply the needed workarounds and will refuse to start.
			The same thing will happen if the OpenSSL versions are too different
			(to force Kamailio startup anyway, see the <varname>tls_force_run</varname>
			module parameter).
		</para>
		<para>
			Compression is fully supported if you have a new enough OpenSSL version
			(starting with 0.9.8). Although there are some problems with zlib compression
			in currently deployed OpenSSL versions (up to and including 0.9.8d, see
			openssl bug #1468), the TLS module will automatically switch to its own fixed version.
			Note however that starting with &kamailio; 3.1 compression is not enabled by
			default, due to the huge extra memory consumption that it causes (about 10x
			more memory). To enable it use
			<emphasis>modparam("tls", "tls_disable_compression", 0)</emphasis>
 			(see <varname>tls_disable_compression</varname>).
		</para>
		<para>
			The TLS module includes workarounds for the following known openssl bugs: 
			<itemizedlist>
                        <listitem><para>
			openssl #1204 (disable SS_OP_TLS_BLOCK_PADDING_BUG if compression is enabled,
			for versions between 0.9.8 and 0.9.8c),
                        </para></listitem>
                        <listitem><para>
			openssl #1468 (fix zlib compression memory allocation),
                        </para></listitem>
                        <listitem><para>
			openssl #1467 (kerberos support will be disabled if the openssl version is less than 0.9.8e-beta1) 
                        </para></listitem>
                        <listitem><para>
			openssl #1491 (stop using tls in low memory situations due to the very high risk of openssl crashing or leaking memory).
                        </para></listitem>
			</itemizedlist>

	<section id="tls.compile">
		<title>Compiling the TLS Module</title>
		<para>
			In most case compiling the TLS module is as simple as:
			<programlisting>
make -C modules/tls
			</programlisting>
			or
			<programlisting>
make modules modules=modules/tls
			</programlisting>
			or (compiling whole Kamailio and the tls module)
			<programlisting>
make all include_modules=tls
			</programlisting>
			.
		</para>
		<para>
			However in some cases the OpenSSL library requires linking with other libraries.
			For example compiling the OpenSSL library with Kerberos and zlib-shared support
			will require linking the TLS module with libkrb5 and libz. In this case just add
			<emphasis>TLS_EXTRA_LIBS</emphasis>="library list" to make's command line. E.g.:
			<programlisting>
make TLS_EXTRA_LIBS="-lkrb5 -lz" all include_modules=tls
			</programlisting>
		</para>
		<para>
			In general, if Kamailio fails to start with a symbol not found error when trying
			to load the TLS module (check the log), it means some needed library was not
			linked and it must be added to <emphasis>TLS_EXTRA_LIBS</emphasis>
		</para>
		<para>
		<ulink url="http://wiki.openssl.org/index.php/Elliptic_Curve_Diffie_Hellman">
		Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (EDCH)</ulink>-Ciphers are only supported in OpenSSL 1.0.0e and later.
		</para>
	</section>

	<section id="tls.low_memory">
		<title>TLS and Low Memory</title>
		<para>
			The Openssl library doesn't handle low memory situations very well. If memory
			allocations start to fail (due to memory shortage), Openssl can crash or cause memory
			leaks (making the memory shortage even worse). As of this writing all Openssl versions
			were affected (including 0.9.8e), see Openssl bug #1491. The TLS module has some
			workarounds for preventing this problem (see <varname>low_mem_treshold1</varname>
			and <varname>low_mem_threshold2</varname>), however starting Kamailio with enough shared
			memory is higly recommended. When this is not possible a quick way to significantly
			reduce Openssl memory usage it to  disable compression (see <varname>tls_disable_compression</varname>).
		</para>
	</section>

	<section id="tls.debugging">
		<title>TLS Debugging</title>
		<para>
			Debugging messages can be selectively enabled by recompiling
			the TLS module with a combination of the following defines:
			<itemizedlist>
				<listitem>
					<para>
						TLS_WR_DEBUG - debug messages for the write/send part.
					</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>
						TLS_RD_DEBUG - debug messages for the read/receive
						part.
					</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>
						TLS_BIO_DEBUG - debug messages for the custom BIO.
					</para>
				</listitem>
			</itemizedlist>
		</para>
		<example>
			<title>Compiling TLS with Debug Messages</title>
			<programlisting>
make -C modules/tls extra_defs="-DTLS_WR_DEBUG -DTLS_RD_DEBUG"
			</programlisting>
		</example>
		<para>
			To change the level at which the debug messages are logged,
			change the <varname>tls_debug</varname> module parameter.
		</para>
	</section>

	<section id="tls.known_limitations">
		<title>Known Limitations</title>
		<para>
			The private key must not be encrypted (Kamailio cannot ask you for a password on startup).
		</para>
		<para>
			The TLS certificate verifications ignores the certificate name, Subject Altname
			and IP extensions, it just checks if the certificate is signed by a recognized CA.
			One can use the select framework to try to overcome this limitation (check in the
			script for the contents of various certificate fields), but this is not only slow,
			but also not exactly standard conforming (the verification should happen during TLS
			connection establishment and not after).
		</para>
		<para>
			TLS specific config reloading is not safe, so for now better don't use it,
			especially under heavy traffic.
		</para>
		<para>
			This documentation is incomplete.
			The provided selects are not documented in this file. A list with all the
			ones implemented by the TLS module can be found in the Cookbook
			<ulink url="&kamwiki;">&kamwiki;</ulink> in the section
			<emphasis>Selects</emphasis> for the respective version of &kamailio;.

	<section id="tls.dbstorage">
		<title>TLS With Database Backend</title>
		<para>
		The module does not connect to database to fetch the values for the
		TLS profile attributes. However the 'kamcli' tool can generate the tls.cfg
		from a database table. Once generated, the 'tls.cfg' can be reloaded with
		an RPC command.
		</para>
		<para>
		The kamcli tool can be found at <ulink url="https://github.com/kamailio/kamcli">https://github.com/kamailio/kamcli</ulink>.
		</para>
		<para>
		The schema to create the database table can be seen with the command: "kamcli tls sqlprint".
		The default name for database table is 'tlscfg'.
		</para>
		<para>
		The most of the column names matches the corresponding attribute names
		from a TLS profile.
		</para>
		<para>
		The profile id in 'tls.cfg' is generated from '[profile_type:profile_name]'.
		The 'profile_type' has to be 'server' or 'client'. The 'profile_name'
		can be 'default', 'any' or the pair of IP address and port like 'ipaddr:port'.
		</para>
		<para>
		The 'file_type' is specifying if the values for 'certificate', 'private_key',
		'ca_list' and 'crl' are path to files on disc (when is set to 0) or the
		content of the files (when set to 1). If 'file_type' is 1, then 'kamcli'
		will create new files on disc and store the values from the database in
		them. The target folder for 'tls.cfg' and the certificates related files
		can be set via command options for 'kamcli tls', for more details see
		the output of 'kamcli tls --help' and 'kamcli tls cfgprint --help'.
