/**
 * @file
 * @brief TM :: Message cloning functionality
 *
 * Cloning a message into shared memory (TM keeps a snapshot
 * of messages in memory); note that many operations, which
 * allocate pkg memory (such as parsing) cannot be used with
 * a cloned message -- it would result in linking pkg structures
 * to shmem msg and eventually in a memory error.
 *
 * The cloned message is stored in a single memory fragment to
 * save too many shm_mallocs -- these are expensive as they
 * not only take lookup in fragment table but also a shmem lock
 * operation (the same for shm_free)
 *
 * Allow postponing the cloning of SIP msg:
 * t_newtran() copies the requests to shm mem without the lumps,
 * and t_forward_nonack() clones the lumps later when it is called
 * the first time.
 * @ingroup tm
