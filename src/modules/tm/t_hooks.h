/*
 *  Caution: most of the callbacks work with shmem-ized messages
 *  which you can no more change (e.g., lumps are fixed). Most
 *  reply-processing callbacks are also called from a mutex,
 *  which may cause deadlock if you are not careful. Also, reply
 *  callbacks may pass the value of FAKED_REPLY messages, which
 *  is a non-dereferencable pointer indicating that no message
 *  was received and a timer hit instead.
 *
 *  All callbacks excepting the TMCB_REQUEST_IN are associates to a
 *  transaction. It means they will be run only when the event will hint
 *  the transaction the callbacks were register for.
 *  TMCB_REQUEST_IN is a global callback - it means it will be run for
 *  all transactions.
 *
 *
 *  Callback description:
 *  ---------------------
 *
 * TMCB_REQUEST_IN -- a brand-new request was received and is
 * about to establish transaction; it is not yet cloned and
 * lives in pkg mem -- your last chance to mangle it before
 * it gets shmem-ized (then, it's read-only); it's called from
 * HASH_LOCK, so be careful. It is guaranteed not to be
 * a retransmission. The transactional context is mostly
 * incomplete -- this callback is called in very early stage
 * before the message is shmem-ized (so that you can work
 * with it).
 * Note: this callback MUST be installed before forking
 * (the req_in_tmcb_hl callback list does not live in shmem and has no access
 * protection), i.e., at best from mod_init functions.
 *
 * Note: All the other callbacks can be safely installed when the
 * transaction already exists, it does not need to be locked.
 *
 * TMCB_RESPONSE_IN -- a brand-new reply was received which matches
 * an existing non-local transaction. It may or may not be a retransmission.
 * No lock is held here (yet).
 * Note: for an invite transaction this callback will also catch the reply
 *  to local cancels (e.g. branch canceled due to fr_inv_timeout). To
 *  distinguish between the two, one would need to look at the method in
 *  Cseq (look at t_reply.c:1630 (reply_received()) for an example).
 *
 *  TMCB_RESPONSE_OUT -- a final or provisional reply was sent out
 *  successfully (either a local reply  or a proxied one).
 *  For final replies is called only for the first one (it's not called
 *  for retransmissions).
 *  For non-local replies (proxied) is called also for provisional responses
 *  (NOTE: this might change and in the future it might be called only
 *  for final replies --andrei).
 *  For local replies is called _only_ for the final reply.
 *  There is nothing more you can change from the callback, it is good for
 *  accounting-like uses. No lock is held.
 *  Known oddities: it's called for provisional replies for relayed replies,
 *  but not for local responses (see NOTE above).
 *  Note: if the send fails or via cannot be resolved, this callback is
 *  _not_ called.
 *  Note: local reply means locally generated reply (via t_reply() & friends)
 *  and not local transaction.
 *
 *    Note: the message passed to the callback may also have
 *    value FAKED_REPLY (like other reply callbacks) which
 *    indicates a local reply caused by a timer, calling t_reply() a.s.o.
*     Check for this value before deferring -- you will cause a segfault
 *    otherwise. Check for t->uas.request validity too if you
 *    need it ... locally initiated UAC transactions set it to 0.
 *
 *    Also note, that reply callbacks are not called if a transaction
 *    is dropped silently. That's the case when noisy_ctimer is
 *    disabled (by default) and C-timer hits. The proxy server then
 *    drops state silently, doesn't use callbacks and expects the
 *    transaction to complete statelessly.
 *
 *  TMCB_ON_FAILURE_RO -- called on receipt of a reply or timer;
 *  it means all branches completed with a failure; the callback
 *  function MUST not change anything in the transaction (READONLY)
 *  that's a chance for doing ACC or stuff like this
 *
 *  TMCB_ON_FAILURE -- called on receipt of a reply or timer;
 *  it means all branches completed with a failure; that's
 *  a chance for example to add new transaction branches.
 *  WARNING: the REPLY lock is held.
 *  It is safe to add more callbacks from here.
 *
 *  TMCB_RESPONSE_FWDED -- called when a reply is about to be
 *  forwarded; it is called after a message is received but before
 *  a message is sent out: it is called when the decision is
 *  made to forward a reply; it is parametrized by pkg message
 *  which caused the transaction to complete (which is not
 *  necessarily the same which will be forwarded). As forwarding
 *  has not been executed and may fail, there is no guarantee
 *  a reply will be successfully sent out at this point of time.
 *
 *     Note: TMCB_ON_FAILURE and TMCB_REPLY_FWDED are
 *     called from reply mutex which is used to deterministically
 *     process multiple replies received in parallel. A failure
 *     to set the mutex again or stay too long in the callback
 *     may result in deadlock.
 *
 *     Note: the reply callbacks will not be evoked if "silent
 *     C-timer hits". That's a feature to clean transactional
 *     state from a proxy quickly -- transactions will then
 *     complete statelessly. If you wish to disable this
 *     feature, either set the global option "noisy_ctimer"
 *     to 1, or set t->noisy_ctimer for selected transaction.
 *
 *  TMCB_E2EACK_IN -- called when an ACK belonging to a proxied
 *  INVITE transaction completed with 200 arrived. Note that
 *  because it can be only dialog-wise matched, only the first
 *  transaction occurrence will be matched with spirals. If
 *  record-routing is not enabled, you will never receive the
 *  ACK and the callback will be never triggered. In general it's called only
 *   for the first ACK but it can be also called multiple times
 *   quasi-simultaneously if multiple ACK copies arrive in parallel or if
 *   ACKs with different (never seen before) to-tags are received.
 *
 *   TMCB_E2EACK_RETR_IN -- like TMCB_E2EACK_IN, but matches retransmissions
 *   and it's called for every retransmission (but not for the "first" ACK).
 *
 *  TMCB_E2ECANCEL_IN -- called when a CANCEL for the INVITE transaction
 *  for which the callback was registered arrives.
 *   The transaction parameter will point to the invite transaction (and
 *   not the cancel) and the request parameter to the CANCEL sip msg.
 *   Note: the callback should be registered for an INVITE transaction.
 *
 *  TMCB_REQUEST_FWDED -- request is being forwarded out. It is
 *  called before a message is forwarded, when the corresponding branch
 *   is created (it's called for each branch) and it is your last
 *  chance to change its shape. It can also be called from the failure
 *   router (via t_relay/t_forward_nonack) and in this case the REPLY lock
 *   will be held.
 *
 *  TMCB_REQUEST_OUT -- request was sent out successfully.
 *  There is nothing more you can change from the callback, it is good for
 *  accounting-like uses.
 *  Note: if the send fails or via cannot be resolved, this callback is
 *  _not_ called.
 *
 *  TMCB_LOCAL_COMPLETED -- final reply for localy initiated
 *  transaction arrived. Message may be FAKED_REPLY. Can be called multiple
 *  times, no lock is held.
 *
 *  TMCB_LOCAL_RESPONSE_OUT -- provisional reply for localy initiated
 *  transaction. The message may be a FAKED_REPLY and the callback might be
 *  called multiple time quasi-simultaneously. No lock is held.
 *  Note: depends on tm.pass_provisional_replies.
 *  Note: the name is very unfortunate and it will probably be changed
 *   (e.g. TMCB_LOCAL_PROVISIONAL).
 *
 *  TMCB_NEG_ACK_IN -- an ACK to a negative reply was received, thus ending
 *  the transaction (this happens only when the final reply sent by tm is
 *  negative). The callback might be called simultaneously. No lock is held.
 *
 *  TMCB_REQ_RETR_IN -- a retransmitted request was received. This callback
 *   might be called simultaneously. No lock is held.
 *
 * TMCB_LOCAL_RESPONSE_IN -- a brand-new reply was received which matches
 * an existing local transaction (like TMCB_RESPONSE_IN but for local
 * transactions). It may or may not be a retransmission.
 *
 * TMCB_LOCAL_REQUEST_IN -- like TMCB_REQUEST_IN but for locally generated
 * request (e.g. via fifo/rpc):  a brand-new local request was
 * received/generated and a transaction for it is about to be created.
 * It's called from HASH_LOCK, so be careful. It is guaranteed not to be
 * a retransmission. The transactional context is mostly
 * incomplete -- this callback is called in very early stage
 * before the message is shmem-ized (so that you can work
 * with it).
 * It's safe to install other TMCB callbacks from here.
 * Note: this callback MUST be installed before forking
 * (the local_req_in_tmcb_hl callback list does not live in shmem and has no
 * access protection), i.e., at best from mod_init functions.
 *
 *
 *  All of the following callbacks are called immediately after or before
 *  sending a message. All of them are read-only (no change can be made to
 * the message). These callbacks use the t_rbuf, send_buf, dst, is_retr
 *  and the code members of the tmcb_params structure.
 *  For a request code is <=0. code values can be TYPE_LOCAL_ACK for an ACK
 *  generated by ser, TYPE_LOCAL_CANCEL for a CANCEL generated by ser
 *  and TYPE_REQUEST for all the other requests or requests generated via
 *  t_uac.
 *   For a reply the code is the response status (which is always >0, e.g. 200,
 *   408, a.s.o).
 *        - the callbacks will be called sometimes with the REPLY lock held
 *          and sometimes without it, so trying to acquire the REPLY lock
 *          from these callbacks could lead to deadlocks (avoid it unless
 *           you really know what you're doing).
 *
 *  TMCB_REQUEST_SENT -- called each time a request was sent (even for
 *  retransmissions), it includes local and forwarded request, ser generated
 *  CANCELs and ACKs. The tmcb_params structure will have the t_rbuf, dst,
 *  send_buf and is_retr members filled.
 *  This callback is "read-only", the message was already sent and no changes
 *  are allowed.
 *  Note: send_buf can be different from t_rbuf->buffer for ACKs (in this
 *   case t_rbuf->buf will contain the last request sent on the branch and
 *   its destination). The same goes for t_rbuf->dst and tmcb->dst for local
 *   transactions ACKs to 2xxs.
 *
 *  TMCB_RESPONSE_SENT -- called each time a response was sent (even for
 *  retransmissions). The tmcb_params structure will have t_rbuf set to the
 *  reply retransmission buffer and send_buf set to the data sent (in this case
 *  it will always be the same with t_rbuf->buf). is_retr will also be set if
 *  the reply is retransmitted
 *   by ser.
 *  This callback is "read-only", the message was already sent and no changes
 *  are allowed.
 *
 *  TMCB_DESTROY -- called when the transaction is destroyed. Everything but
 *  the cell* parameter (t) and the tmcb are set to 0. Only the param is
 *  is filled inside TMCB. For dialogs callbacks t is also 0.
 *
 * TMCB_RESPONSE_READY -- a reply is ready to be sent out. Callback is
 *  is executed just before writing the reply content to network.
 *
 * TMCB_DONT_ACK (requires AS support) -- for localy generated INVITEs, TM
 * automatically generates an ACK for the received 2xx replies. But, if this
 * flag is passed to TM when creating the initial UAC request, this won't
 * happen anymore: the ACK generation must be triggered from outside, using
 * TM's interface.
 * While this isn't exactly a callback type, it is used as part of the flags
 * mask when registering callbacks.

	the callback's param MUST be in shared memory and will
	NOT be freed by TM; you must do it yourself from the
	callback function if necessary (for example register it also for
	TMCB_DESTROY and when called with TMCB_DESTROY just free the param
	).
