 * \file
 * \brief SNMP statistic module, hash table
 *
 * This file describes several structure.  In general, it was necessary to map
 * between Kamailio's "aor" (Address of Record) and string indexing mechanisms,
 * and the SNMPStats modules integer indexing scheme for users and contacts.
 * While it would have been a more natural fit to use string indexes in the
 * SNMPStats module, SNMP limitations precluded this.  
 *
 * aorToIndexStruct: maps an aor to:
 *  - a userIndex, to uniquely identify each RegUserTable SNMP row
 *  - a contactList, containing all contacts for the user specified by
 *    userIndex.
 *
 * The aorToIndexStruct also contains a numContacts counter. Each time a new
 * contact is associated with the aor (user), the counter is incremented.  Each
 * time a contact is dissasociated (due to an expiration), the counter is
 * decremented.  When the counter reaches zero the structure will be deleted.
 *
 *  contactToIndexStruct: maps a contact name to:
 *   - a contactIndex, used to uniquely identify each ContactTable SNMP row.
