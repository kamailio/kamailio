 * Structure and prototype definitions for the SNMPStats module.
 *
 * There are some important points to understanding the SNMPStat modules
 * architecture.
 *
 * 1) The SNMPStats module will fork off a new process in mod_child_init when
 *    the rank is equal to PROC_MAIN_PROCESS.  The sub-process will be
 *    responsible for registering with a master agent (the source of snmp
 *    requests), and handling all received requests. 
 *
 * 2) The Module will register a periodic alarm checking function with a sip
 *    timer using register_timer().  This function checks for alarm conditions,
 *    and will send out traps to the master agent when it detects their
 *    presence.
 *
 * 3) The SNMPStats module is required to run an external application upon
 *    startup, to collect sysUpTime data from the master agent.  This involves
 *    spawning a short-lived process.  For this reason, the module temporarily
 *    installs a new SIGCHLD handler to deal specifically with this process.  It
 *    does not change the normal SIGCHLD behaviour for any process except for
 *    this short lived sysUpTime process. 
 *
 * 4) mod_init() will initialize some interprocess communication buffers, as
 *    well as callback mechanisms for the usrloc module.  To understand what the
 *    interprocess buffer and callbacks are and are for, please see the
 *    respective comments in interprocess_buffer.h, kamailioSIPRegUserTable.h,
 *    and kamailioSIPContactTable.h.
