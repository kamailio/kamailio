 * \file
 * \brief SNMP statistic module, interprocess buffer
 *
 * The SNMPStats module exposes user information through kamailioSIPRegUserTable,
 * kamailioSIPContactTable, and kamailioSIPRegUserLookupTable.  These tables are
 * populated through callback mechanisms from the usrloc module.  Unfortunately
 * the NetSNMP table population code is very slow when dealing with large
 * amounts of data.  Because we don't want to experience a performance hit when
 * registering users, we make use of the interprocess buffer.  Specifically,
 * instead of adding/removing users/contacts from the SNMP tables directly, the
 * callbacks add an add/delete command to the interprocessBuffer.
 *
 * When an snmp request is received by the SNMPStats sub-process, it will
 * consume this interprocess buffer, adding and deleting users.  When it is
 * finished, it can service the SNMP request.
 *
 * This doesn't remove the NetSNMP inefficiency of course, but it does move it
 * to a non-critical path.  Such an approach allows SNMP support with almost no
 * overhead to the rest of the server.

/* Interprocess Buffer consumption Function.  This function will iterate over
 * every element of the interprocess buffer, and add or remove the specified
 * contacts and users.  Whether the contacts are added or removed is dependent
 * on if the original element was added as a result of a UL_CONTACT_INSERT or
 * UL_CONTACT_EXPIRE callback.
 *
 * The function will free any memory occupied by the interprocess buffer.
 *
 * Note: This function is believed to be thread safe.  Specifically, it protects
 *       corruption of the interprocess buffer through the interprocessCBLock.
 *       This ensures no corruption of the buffer by race conditions.  The lock
 *       has been designed to be occupied for as short a period as possible, so 
 *       as to prevent long waits.  Specifically, once we start consumption of 
 *       the list, other processes are free to continue even before we are done.
 *       This is made possible by simply changing the head of the interprocess
 *       buffer, and then releasing the lock.
