 * This file defines the prototypes that implement the kamailioSIPRegUserTable.
 * For a full description of the table, please see the KAMAILIO-SIP-SERVER-MIB.
 *
 * Understanding this code will be much simpler with the following information:
 *
 * 1) All rows are indexed by an integer user index.  This is different from the
 *    usrloc module, which indexes by strings.  This less natural indexing
 *    scheme was required due to SNMP String index limitations.  (for example,
 *    SNMP has maximum index lengths.)
 *
 * 2) We need a quick way of mapping usrloc indices to our integer indices.  For
 *    this reason a string indexed Hash Table was created, with each entry mapping
 *    to an integer user index. 
 *
 *    This hash table is used by the kamailioSIPContactTable (the hash table also
 *    maps a user to its contacts), as well as the kamailioSIPRegUserLookupTable.
 *    The hash table is also used for quick lookups when a user expires. (i.e, it
 *    gives us a more direct reference, instead of having to search the whole
 *    table).
 *
 * 3) We are informed about new/expired users via a callback mechanism from the
 *    usrloc module.  Because of NetSNMP inefficiencies, we had to abstract this
 *    process.  Specifically:
 *
 *    - It can take a long time for the NetSNMP code base to populate a table with
 *      a large number of records. 
 *
 *    - We rely on callbacks for updated user information. 
 *
 *    Clearly, using the SNMPStats module in this situation could lead to some
 *    big performance loses if we don't find another way to deal with this.  The
 *    solution was to use an interprocess communications buffer.  
 *
 *    Instead of adding the record directly to the table, the callback functions
 *    now adds either an add/delete command to the interprocessBuffer.  When an
 *    snmp request is received by the SNMPStats sub-process, it will consume
 *    this interprocess buffer, adding and deleting users.  When it is finished,
 *    it can service the SNMP request.  
 *
 *    This doesn't remove the NetSNMP inefficiency, but instead moves it to a
 *    non-critical path.  Such an approach allows SNMP support with almost no
 *    overhead to the rest of Kamailio.
