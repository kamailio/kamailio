   3. Parameters

        3.1. xlbuf_size (integer)

1. Overview

   This module contains several functions that can be used to manipulate
   the contents of AVPs (Attribute-Value pairs). The AVPs are variables
   attached to the SIP message being processed. Each variable has its name
   and value. AVPs can be used to store arbitrary data or as a means of
   inter-module communication.

   You may also want to check the avpops module which is more flexible and
   contains more functions. In future Kamailio releases the avp module
   will be probably deprecated in favor of avpops module.

   Create an AVP of type integer.

   Meaning of the parameter is as follows:
     * attribute - The name of the AVP to be created.
     * value - Integer value of the AVP.

   Example 1.1. set_iattr usage
...
set_iattr("fr_inv_timer", "60")
...

2.2. flags2attr("$avp")

   Store the current state of Kamailio flags into the specified AVP.

...

2.4. print_attr($attribute)

   Print the value of an AVP to syslog.

   Meaning of the parameter is as follows:
     * attribute - The name of the AVP.

2.5. attr2uri($attribute[,uri-part])

   Rewrite the whole Request-URI of the message being processed with the
   value of an AVP, or if an uri-part is specified, rewrite only that
   specific part.

   Meaning of the parameter is as follows:
     * $attribute - The name of the AVP.

       "hostport", "port", "strip", "strip_tail". "prefix" will add the
       AVP as a prefix to the username (equivalent to prefix("string")),
       "strip" and "strip_tail" expect a number in the AVP and they will
       remove the specified number of characters from the beginning,
       respective the end of the username part of the uri. The rest of the
       uri-part values names are self-explaining.

2.6. attr_exists(attribute)
