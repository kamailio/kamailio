 * The initial version of this code was written by Dragos Vingarzan
 * (dragos(dot)vingarzan(at)fokus(dot)fraunhofer(dot)de and the
 * Fruanhofer Institute. It was and still is maintained in a separate
 * branch of the original SER. We are therefore migrating it to
 * Kamailio/SR and look forward to maintaining it from here on out.
 * 2011/2012 Smile Communications, Pty. Ltd.
 * ported/maintained/improved by
 * Jason Penton (jason(dot)penton(at)smilecoms.com and
 * Richard Good (richard(dot)good(at)smilecoms.com) as part of an
 * effort to add full IMS support to Kamailio/SR using a new and
 * improved architecture
 *
 * NB: Alot of this code was originally part of OpenIMSCore,
 * FhG Fokus.

 * Thanks for great work! This is an effort to
 * break apart the various CSCF functions into logically separate
 * components. We hope this will drive wider use. We also feel
 * that in this way the architecture is more complete and thereby easier
 * to manage in the Kamailio/SR environment
