1. Overview

   This module can delegate processing of SIP requests to a group of
   workers in the configuration file by using
   event_route[core:pre-routing]. The async workers have to defined with
   the global parameter. The worker process that received the message
   internally does the usual execution of the config script, running
   request_route or reply_route.

   Note: the behaviour is different than the async module, because it does
   not create the transaction (obviously also not performing suspend).

   Note: it does not propagate anything set in the event_route, therefore
   any set flag, or avp, etc. are lost. The SIP message is processed by
   the delegated worker as it was fresh received from the network
   (including parsing).

2. Dependencies

   2.1. Kamailio Modules
   2.2. External Libraries or Applications

2.1. Kamailio Modules

   The following modules must be loaded before this module:
     * None.

2.2. External Libraries or Applications

   The following libraries or applications must be installed before
   running Kamailio with this module loaded:
     * None

3. Parameters

   3.1. xdata (str)

3.1.  xdata (str)

   Name of a script variable from where to take additional data to be
   passed to special worker along with the SIP message. Same variable will
   be set by the special worker, therefore it has to be a writable
   variable. Moreover, it must be a variable that can be set without the
   SIP message structure, like $var(name), otherwise it can lead to a
   crash.

   Default value: not set.

   Example 1.1. xdata usage
...
modparam("sworker", "xdata", "$var(xdata)")
...

4. Functions

   4.1. sworker_active()
   4.2. swork_task(gname)

4.1.  sworker_active()

   Return 1 (true) if the processing happens in an asyn process, or -1
   (false) if the processing is happening in a SIP receiving process.

   This function can be used from REQUEST_ROUTE|CORE_REPLY_ROUTE.

   Example 1.2. sworker_active() usage
...
request_route {
    ...
    if(sworker_active()) {
    }
    ...
}
...

4.2.  swork_task(gname)

   Delegate the processing of SIP message to a group of async workers. The
   function is restricted to be used inside event_route[core:pre-routing].

   The parameter gname provides the name of the group workers, it can
   contain pseudo-variables.

   The function returns 1 (true) in case the task is delegated. After
   that, 'drop' must be used so processing of the message does not
   continue to request_route or reply_route in the same process, it is
   going to be done by the delegated group of workers. It returns -1
   (false) in case there was a problem delegating the processing.

   This function can be used from REQUEST_ROUTE|CORE_REPLY_ROUTE.

   Example 1.3. sworker_task() usage
...
event_route[core:pre-routing] {
        if(sworker_task("default")) {
                xinfo("===== delegate processing [$Tf] [$si:$sp]\n");
                drop;
        }
        xinfo("===== processing continues [$Tf] [$si:$sp]\n");
    ...
}
...
