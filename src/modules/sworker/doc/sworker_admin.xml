	<title>Overview</title>
	<para>
		This module can delegate processing of SIP requests to a group of
		workers in the configuration file by using event_route[core:pre-routing].
		The async workers have to defined with the global parameter. The worker
		process that received the message internally does the usual execution
		of the config script, running request_route or reply_route.
	</para>
	<para>
		Note: the behaviour is different than the async module, because it does
		not create the transaction (obviously also not performing suspend).
	</para>
	<para>
		Note: it does not propagate anything set in the event_route, therefore
		any set flag, or avp, etc. are lost. The SIP message is processed by the
		delegated worker as it was fresh received from the network (including
		parsing).

	<section id="sworker.f.sworker_active">
		<title>
		<function moreinfo="none">sworker_active()</function>
		</title>
		<para>
		Return 1 (true) if the processing happens in an asyn process, or -1
		(false) if the processing is happening in a SIP receiving process.
		</para>
		<para>
		This function can be used from REQUEST_ROUTE|CORE_REPLY_ROUTE.
		</para>
		<example>
		<title><function>sworker_active()</function> usage</title>
		<programlisting format="linespecific">
...
request_route {
    ...
    if(sworker_active()) {
    }
    ...
}
...
</programlisting>

	</section>
	<section id="sworker.f.swork_task">
		<title>
		<function moreinfo="none">swork_task(gname)</function>
		</title>
		<para>
		Delegate the processing of SIP message to a group of async workers. The
		function is restricted to be used inside event_route[core:pre-routing].
		</para>
		<para>
		The parameter gname provides the name of the group workers, it can
		contain pseudo-variables.
		</para>
		<para>
		The function returns 1 (true) in case the task is delegated. After that,
		'drop' must be used so processing of the message does not continue to
		request_route or reply_route in the same process, it is going to be done
		by the delegated group of workers. It returns -1 (false) in case there
		was a proble delegating the processing.
		</para>
		<para>
		This function can be used from REQUEST_ROUTE|CORE_REPLY_ROUTE.
		</para>
		<example>
		<title><function>sworker_task()</function> usage</title>
		<programlisting format="linespecific">
...
event_route[core:pre-routing] {
	if(sworker_task("default")) {
		xinfo("===== delegate processing [$Tf] [$si:$sp]\n");
		drop;

	xinfo("===== processing continues [$Tf] [$si:$sp]\n");
