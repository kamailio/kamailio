1. Overview

   The SL module allows the SIP server to act as a stateless UA server and
   generate replies to SIP requests without keeping state. That is
   beneficial in many scenarios, in which you wish not to burden server's
   memory and scale well.

   The SL module needs to filter ACKs sent after a local stateless reply
   to an INVITE was generated. To recognize such ACKs, Kamailio adds a
   special "signature" in to-tags. This signature is sought for in
   incoming ACKs, and if included, the ACKs are absorbed.

   To speed up the filtering process, the module uses a timeout mechanism.
   When a reply is sent, a timer is set. As long as the timer is valid,
   the incoming ACK requests will be checked using TO tag value. Once the
   timer expires, all the ACK messages are let through - a long time
   passed till it sent a reply, so it does not expect any ACK that have to
   be blocked.

   The ACK filtering may fail in some rare cases. If you think these
   matter to you, better use stateful processing (TM module) for INVITE
   processing. Particularly, the problem happens when a UA sends an INVITE
   which already has a to-tag in it (e.g., a re-INVITE) and the server
   wants to reply to it. Then, it will keep the current to-tag, which will
   be mirrored in ACK. Kamailio will not see its signature and forward the
   ACK downstream. Caused harm is not bad, just a useless ACK is
   forwarded.

   Example 1.1. default_code example
...
modparam("sl", "default_code", 505)
...

2.2. default_reason (str)

   Default reply reason phrase.

   Default value is 'Internal Server Error'.

2.3. bind_tm (int)

   Controls if SL module should attempt to bind to TM module in order to

   Default value is 1 (enabled).

   Example 1.3. bind_tm example
...
modparam("sl", "bind_tm", 0)  # feature disabled
...

2.4. rich_redirect (int)

   When sending a 3xx class reply, include additional branch info to the
   contacts such as path vector and branch flags.
     * 0 - no extra info is added (default)
     * 1 - include branch flags as contact header parameter
     * 2 - include path as contact uri Route header

   Values may be combined (added).

   Example 1.4. rich_redirect example
...
modparam("sl", "rich_redirect", 3)
...

2.5. event_callback_fl_ack (str)

   The name of the KEMI callback function to be executed instead of
   event_route[sl:filtered-ack]. This function receives a string
   parameter.

   Default value: not set.

   Example 1.5. event_callback_fl_ack example
...
modparam("sl", "event_callback_fl_ack", "ksr_event_sl_filtered_ack")
...

2.6. event_callback_lres_sent (str)

   The name of the KEMI callback function to be executed instead of
   event_route[sl:local-response]. This function receives a string
   parameter.

   Default value: not set.

   Example 1.6. event_callback_lres_sent example
...
modparam("sl", "event_callback_lres_sent", "ksr_event_sl_local_response")
...

3. Functions

   3.1. sl_send_reply(code, reason)
   3.2. send_reply(code, reason)
   3.3. send_reply_mode(code, reason, mode)
   3.4. sl_reply_error()
   3.5. sl_forward_reply([ code, [ reason ] ])

3.1.  sl_send_reply(code, reason)

   For the current request, a reply is sent back having the given code and
   text reason. The reply is sent stateless, totally independent of the
   Transaction module and with no retransmission for the INVITE's replies.

   If the code is in the range 300-399 (redirect reply), the current
   destination set is appended to the reply as Contact headers. The
   destination set contains the request URI (R-URI), if it is modified
   compared to the received one, plus the branches added to the request
   (e.g., after an append_branch() or lookup("location")). If the R-URI
   was changed but it is not desired to be part of the destination set, it
   can be reverted using the function revert_uri().

   Custom headers to the reply can be added using append_to_reply()
   function from textops module.

   Meaning of the parameters is as follows:
     * code - Return code.
     * reason - Reason phrase.

   Example 1.7. sl_send_reply usage
...
sl_send_reply("404", "Not found");
...

3.2.  send_reply(code, reason)

   For the current request, a reply is sent back having the given code and
   text reason. The reply is sent stateful or stateless, depending of the
   TM module: if a transaction exists for the current request, then the
   reply is sent statefully, otherwise stateless.

   Meaning of the parameters is as follows:
     * code - Return code.
     * reason - Reason phrase.

   This function can be used from REQUEST_ROUTE and FAILURE_ROUTE. It can
   be used on ONREPLY_ROUTE executed by tm module (upon a t_on_reply()
   callback).

   Example 1.8. send_reply usage
...
send_reply("404", "Not found");
...
send_reply("403", "Invalid user - $fU");
...

3.3.  send_reply_mode(code, reason, mode)

   Similar to send_reply() function, with additional third parameter mode,
   which can specify extra operations to be done along with sending the
   SIP response.

   The parameter mode is a flag-based value and can be a combination of:
     * 1 - do not connect to send the response (similar to
       set_reply_no_connect()).
     * 2 - close the connection after sending the response (similar to
       set_reply_close()).

   Example 1.9. send_reply_mode usage
...
send_reply_mode("404", "Not found", "3");
...
send_reply_mode("403", "Invalid user - $fU", "3");
...

3.4.  sl_reply_error()

   Sends back an error reply describing the nature of the last internal
   error. Usually this function should be used after a script function
   that returned an error code.

   Example 1.10. sl_reply_error usage
...
sl_reply_error();
...

3.5.  sl_forward_reply([ code, [ reason ] ])

   Forward statelessly the current received SIP reply, with the option to
   change the status code and reason text. The new code has to be in the
   same class. The received reply is forwarded as well by core when the
   config execution ended, unless it is dropped from config.

   Meaning of the parameters is as follows:
     * code - Status code.
     * reason - Reason phrase.

   This function can be used from ONREPLY_ROUTE.

   Example 1.11. send_reply usage
...
if(status=="408")
    sl_forward_reply("404", "Not found");
...
