/* This module reports originating and terminating call set up and duration usage
 * for OSP transactions.
 *
 * Call set-up usage is reported based on the osp_dest structures stored as AVPs.
 * It includes OSP transaction id, response codes, start time, alert time,
 * connect time, etc.
 *
 * Duration usage is reported based on the OSP cooky recorded into the route set
 * (using add_rr_param) after requesting routing/authorization on the originating
 * side, and validating authorization on the terminating side.  It include 
 * OSP transaction id, duration, stop time, etc.
 * 
 * Actual conversation duration maybe calculated using connect time (from the call
 * set up usage) and stop time (from the duration usage).
