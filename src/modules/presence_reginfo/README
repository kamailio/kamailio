1. Overview

   The module enables the handling of "Event: reg" (as defined in RFC
   3680) inside of the presence module. This can be used distribute the
   registration-info status to the subscribed watchers.

   The module does not currently implement any authorization rules. It
   assumes that publish requests are only issued by an authorized
   application and subscribe requests only by authorized users.
   Authorization can thus be easily done in Kamailio configuration file
   before calling handle_publish() and handle_subscribe() functions.

   Note: This module only activates the processing of the "reg" in the
   presence module. To send dialog-info to watchers you also need a source
   which PUBLISH the reg info to the presence module. For example you can
   use the pua_reginfo module or any external component. This approach
   allows to have the presence server and the reg-info aware publisher
   (e.g. the main proxy) on different Kamailio instances.
