The licensing matches the rules for core - owned by FhG or more liberal
like BSD or MIT style.

1. TMREC
========

Time recurrence matching, with recurrences defined based on specifications
by Internet Calendaring and Scheduling Core Object Specification (Calendar
COS - RFC 2445)

2. SRJSON
=========

Adapted verision of cJSON - a C JSON parsing library - that integrates better
with Kamailio environment.

The changes so far:
  - rename cJSON to srjson to avoid name space conflicts
  - ability to specify malloc/free functions per JSON document. In
  Kamailio based on needs, it can be PKG or SHM type of used memory.
  - ability to add a string value by pointer and length - the very common
  str structure

Next targets:
- option to clone or not the full JSON document buffer and parse using
  the clone (tied to and becomes usefule with the next item in this list)
  - don't clone the string values when parsing a JSON document, but set
  references to names and string values
  - add functions to make easy to add binary data in string values, stored
  in base32 or base64 format
