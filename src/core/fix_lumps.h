/** @brief used to delete attached via lumps from msg;

   msg can be either an original pkg msg, whose Via lump I want
   to delete before generating next branch, or a shmem-stored
   message processed during on_reply -- then I want to
   delete the Via lump for the same reason

   the other case when I want to delete them is when a message
   is stored in shmem for branch picking, forwarded lated and
   Via removal is applied to the shmem-ed message

   the same thing for Content-Length lumps (FIXME: this
   should be done in a nicer way)
