This directory contains the generic database support interface - db1. The interface 
should be used by all modules willing to communicate with a database. Kamailio
can then switch from one database to another simply by loading a different 
database support module. For documentation please have a look to doxygen
comments in the respective header files.

The directory schema contains the XML structure for the different databases
definitions. Please use this structure, don't add SQL files for table
definitions directly.
