/**
 * \defgroup dtrie Kamailio generic trie data structure
 * \brief Trie datastructure with utility functions
 *
 * Provides a generic trie data structure and utility functions to
 * initialize and manage individual nodes. Its optimized towards
 * the usecase of a matching tree that contains only digits, e.g.
 * for LCR or blocklist modules. Nevertheless it also supports the
 * matching of characters when configured correctly. For normal
 * digit only matching you need to use a branches parameter of
 * 10, when you use 128, the complete standard ascii charset is
 * available for matching. The trie is setup in shared memory.
 * - Module: \ref carrierroute
