<title>String</title>

<partintro>
<para>String is basic data structure. Standard zero terminated C strings have
some bad properties which may slow down processing or disallow use of binary
values. This structure is an attempt to do it better :-).</para>
<para>This structure was taken from SIP Express
Router due to it's usability and need of testing some parts of SER's code
outside of <quote>SER's environment</quote>. Many of string functions were
inspired by or directly taken from SER's code. Another reason for this structure 
was to put string operations to one place and not leave them independently and
often duplictly in SER's modules.</para>
