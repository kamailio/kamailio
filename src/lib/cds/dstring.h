 *
 * Dynamic strings were introduced to satisfy needs of presence
 * modules when building presence documents.
 *
 * Dynamic string uses a list of buffers holding data. 
 * Buffers are allocated when needed - when there is not enough
 * space in the last buffer. The whole result can be copied into one
 * destination buffer with \ref dstr_get_data, \ref dstr_get_str
 * or \ref dstr_get_str_pkg function.
 *
 * \todo Function with sprintf syntax which will help with 
 * readibility of code using dynamic strings.
