| CAUTION: the 0.8.11 release include changes which      |
| are incompatible with scripts and databases used       |
| in previous versions. Care is advised when upgrading   |
| from previous releases to 0.8.11.                      |
+--------------------------------------------------------+



1. Supported Architectures and Requirements
-------------------------------------------

Supported arhitectures: Linux/i386, Linux/armv4l, FreeBSD/i386, OpenBSD/i386
Solaris/sparc64 
(for other arhitectures the Makefiles might need to be edited)

There are various configuration options defined in the Makefile.

Requirements:


- gcc or icc : gcc >= 2.9x; 3.[12] recommended (it will work with older version
  but it might require some options tweaking for best performance)
- bison or yacc (Berkley yacc)
- flex
- GNU make (on Linux this is the standard "make", on FreeBSD and Solaris is
 called "gmake") version >= 3.79.
- sed and tr (used in the makefiles)
- GNU tar ("gtar" on Solaris) and gzip if you want "make tar" to work
- GNU install or BSD install (on Solaris "ginstall") if you want "make
  install", "make bin", "make sunpkg" to work
- libmysqlclient & libz (zlib) if you want mysql support (the mysql module)
- libexpat if you want the jabber gateway support (the jabber module)


OS Notes:

- FreeBSD/OpenBSD: make sure gmake, bison or yacc & flex are installed
- Solaris: as above; you can use Solaris's yacc instead of bison. You might
  need also gtar and ginstall.
- Windows: it works in windows (only the core, w/o shared mem. support) but you
  must install a recent cygwin version (http://www.cygwin.com/) and also 
  install a newer regex library version (>=0.12). 
    

2. Howto Build ser From Source Distribution
-------------------------------------------

(NOTE: if make doesn't work try gmake  instead)

- compile with default options:

make   #builds only ser core, equivalent to make ser
make modules

or make all #builds everything

- compile with profiling

make PROFILE=-pg all

-compile debug mode version

make mode=debug all

-compile debug version with profiling

make mode=debug PROFILE=-pg all

-compile only the print module

make modules=modules/print modules

-compile all the modules except textops

make exclude_modules="CVS textops" modules

-compile with the "tm" module statically linked and with profiling

make static_modules=tm PROFILE=-pg all

-compile with gcc-3.2 instead of gcc

make CC=gcc-3.2 all

or

CC=gcc-3.2 make all



Make targets:

Clean:

make clean   (clean the modules too)
make proper  (clean also the dependencies)
make distclean (the same as proper)
make mantainer-clean (clean everything, including auto generated files,
 tags, *.dbg a.s.o)

Compile:

make proper
make
(or gmake on non-Linux systems)
make modules 
or make modules exclude_modules="CVS print" etc.

Make tags:

make TAGS

Create a tar.gz with the sources (in ../):

make tar

Create a tar.gz with the binary distribution (in ../):

make bin

Create a gzipped solaris package (in ../):

make sunpkg

Create debian packages (in ../):

make deb

or

dpkg-buildpackage

Install:

make prefix=/usr/local  install



3. Quick-Start Installation Guide
----------------------------------------------

A) Getting Help

This guide gives you instructions on how to set up the SIP Express 
Router (ser) on your box quickly. In case the default configuration
does not fly, check documentation at ser site
  http://www.iptel.org/ser/

If the documentation does not resolve your problem you may try contacting 
us by E-mail at serusers@iptel.org -- that is the mailing list of ser
community from which you can get most rapid help. To participate in the
mailing list, subscribe at the following web address:
  http://mail.iptel.org/mailman/listinfo/serusers

If you are concerned about your privacy, you may post your questions to 
iptel.org's helpline at serhelp@iptel.org.

B) Disclaimers
 
Note well the default "quick-start" configuration is very simple in order 
to be easily installable. It provides minimum features. Particularly, 
authentication is by default disabled, which means anyone can register using
any name with the server. (This is on purpose to avoid installation 
dependencies on MySQL which is needed for storing user credentials.)


C) Quick Start

The following step-by step guide gives you instructions how to install the 
sql-free distribution of ser. If you need persistancy and authentication, 
then you have to install additional MySql support -- proceed to section D)
after you are finished with C).

1) Download an RPM or debian package from our site
    http://www.iptel.org/ser
If you don't use an rpm or debian based distro, try our tar.gz'ed binaries
 (ser-$(version)_$(os)_$(arch).tar.gz, e.g: ser-0.8.8_linux_i386.tar.gz).
If you use Solaris 8 you can try our solaris package.

2) install the package
RPM:
    rpm -i <package_name>
debian:
    dpkg -i <package_name>
tar.gz:
    cd /; tar zxvf <package_name>_os_arch.tar.gz
    (it will install in /usr/local/, and the configuration file in
     /usr/local/etc/ser/ser.cfg)
Solaris:
    gunzip <package_name>.gz ; pkgadd -d <package_name>
    
3) start the server
RPM:
    /etc/init.d/ser start
debian:
    ser is started automatically after the install
    (in case something fails you can start it wiht /etc/init.d/ser start)
tar.gz:
    the tar.gz does not include an init.d script, you'll have to create one of
    your own or adapt one from the source distribution (debian/init.d,
    rpm/ser.init.*, gentoo/ser.init)
    You can start ser directly with /usr/local/sbin/ser.
Solaris:
    see tar.gz.
    
4) optionally, watch server's health using the
   serctl utility
    - to do so, first set the environment variable SIP_DOMAIN to your domain 
      name, e.g., in Bourne shell, call
        export SIP_DOMAIN="myserver.foobar.com"
	- if you are using other than 'localhost' mysql server for maintaining
	  subscriber database, change the variable 'SQL_HOST' to the proper
	  host name in the serctl script
    - run the serctl utility
        /usr/sbin/serctl moni
      or
        /usr/local/sbin/serctl moni (if you installed from a tar.gz or solaris
        package)
5) Register with the server using your favorite
   SIP User Agent. You may want to look at configuration
   hints for use of iptel.org site at
     http://www.iptel.org/phpBB/viewforum.php?forum=1&8
   For example, users of Windows Messenger need to set
   in Tools->Options->Accounts the foolowing values:
     Sign-in Name: <username>@<your_server_address>
     Advanced->Configure Settings (on)
     Advanced->Server: <your_server_address>
     Connect Using: UDP



D) ser with Persistent Data Storage

The default configuration is very simple and features many simplifications. 
In particular, it does not authenticate users and loses User Location 
database on reboot. To provide persistency, keep user credentials and remember 
users' locations across reboots, ser can be configured to use MySQL. Before you 
proceed, you need to make sure MySQL is installed on your box.


1) Download the package containing mysql support for ser from: 
    http://www.iptel.org/ser/
    (rpm and deb provided, most of the binary tar.gz distributions and the 
     solaris package include it; if it is not present you'll have to rebuild
     from the source).
2) install the package
    rpm -i <package_name>
    or
    dpkg -i <package_name>
3) create MySQL tables
	- if you have a previously installed SER on your system, use
    	/usr/sbin/ser_mysql.sh create
	  to convert your SER database into new structures
	- otherwise, if this is your very first installation, use
    	/usr/sbin/ser_mysql.sh create
	  to create SER database structures
   (you will be promted for password of MySql "root" user)
4) configure ser to use SQL
    uncomment all lines in configuration file ser.cfg which are related to 
    authentication:
    - loadmodule "/usr/lib/ser/modules/mysql.so"
    - loadmodule "/usr/lib/ser/modules/auth.so"
    - modparam("usrloc", "db_mode", 2)
    - modparam("auth", "calculate_ha1", yes)
    - if (!www_authorize("iptel.org", "subscriber")) {
        www_challenge("iptel.org", "0"); 
        break;
      }; 
5) be sure to replace realm, the first parameter in www_* actions, 
   with name of your server; some broken UAC implementations don't 
   authenticate otherwise; the authentication command in your
   configuration script should look then like this:
      if (!www_authorize("myserver.foobar.com", "subscriber")) {
        www_challenge("myserver.foobar.com", "0"); 
        break;
      }
6) restart the server
    /etc/init.d/ser restart
7) you can now start  managing the server using the serctl utility; 
   you need to first set the environment variable SIP_DOMAIN to your 
   local SIP realm, e.g.,
       export SIP_DOMAIN="myserver.foobar.com"

   a) watch the server status using 'serctl moni'
   b) try to login with your SIP client as user 'admin' with password 'heslo'
   c) try adding new users using 
       'serctl add <name> <password> <email>'


4. Troubleshooting
------------------

Q: Windows Messenger authentication fails. 

A: The most likely reason for this problem is a bug in Windows Messenger. 
WM only authenticates if server name in request URI equals authentication 
realm. After a challenge is sent by SIP server, WM does not resubmit the 
challenged request at all and pops up authentication window again. If you 
want to authenticate WM, you need to set up your realm value to equal server 
name. If your server has no name, IP address can be used as realm too.

Q: SIP requests are replied by ser with "483 Too Many Hops" or 
   "513 Message Too Large"

A: In both cases, the reason is probably an error in request routing script 
   which caused an infinite loop. You can easily verify whether this happens 
   by watching SIP traffic on loopback interface. A typical reason for misrouting 
   is a failure to match local domain correctly. If a server fails to recognize 
   a request for itself, it will try to forward it to current URI in believe it 
   would forward them to a foreign domain. Alas, it forwards the request to itself 
   again. This continues to happen until value of max_forwards header field reaches 
   zero or the request grows too big. Solutions is easy: make sure that domain matching 
   is correctly configured. A quick way to achieve that is to introduce a config
   option to ser.cfg: alias=domainname, where domainname shall be replaced with
   name of domain, which you wish to server and which appears in request-URIs.
