===================================================

sip-router 3.1 changes

core:
  - Dragonfly BSD support
  - statistics / counters support for tcp and sctp (enable by default)
  - statistics / counters api
  - networks addresses support in ip comparisons (src_ip, dst_ip, to_ip)
    with strings or rvalue expressions.
    E.g.: $ip=10.0.0.0;  if (src_ip == $ip +"/8") ....
  - lots of module functions automatically support now expressions or
      variables in function parameters. This applies to all the module
      functions declared without a fixup, with a fixup and the corresponding
      free_fixup function or with a compatible ser or kamailio style standard
      fixup (declared in sr_module.h or mod_fix.h).
      E.g.: f($a, "b = " + $b);  t_set_fr($v + 2 + $x).
            t_set_fr($foo) (equivalent now with t_set_fr("$foo")).
  - all the module functions can now be called with any constant expression
      as parameters. E.g.: f("7 *" +" 6 = " + 7 * 6);
  - major performance increase on Linux multi-cpu machines that send a lot
     of UDP IPv4 packets (40-50% faster in stateless mode). For it to work
     udp4_raw must be enabled or set into auto mode in sr.cfg and sr must be
     started as root or with CAP_NET_RAW. Note that even if udp4_raw is
     off (default), if sr was started with enough privileges, it can be
     enabled at runtime.
     The support for using raw sockets is also available on FreeBSD (compiled
     by default but not tested for performance yet), NetBSD, OpenBSD and
     Darwin (not tested and not compiled by default, needs
     make cfg extra_defs=-DUSE_RAW_SOCKS). To check if the support is
     compiled, use ser -V |grep --color RAW_SOCKS or for a running
     ser: sercmd core.udp4_raw_info.
     See udp4_raw, udp4_raw_mtu and udp4_raw_ttl below.
  - asynchronous TLS support
  - onreply_route {...} is now equivalent with onreply_route[0] {...}
  - global, per protocol blacklist ignore masks (via extended send_flags).
    See dst_blacklist_udp_imask a.s.o (dst_blacklist_*_imask).
  - per message blacklist ignore masks
  - route() now supports rvalue expressions (e.g. route("test"+$i))
  - support for permanent entries in the DNS cache.

new config variables:
  - udp4_raw - enables raw socket support for sending UDP IPv4 datagrams 
      (40-50% performance increase on linux multi-cpu).
      Possible values: 0 - disabled (default), 1 - enabled, -1 auto.
      In "auto" mode it will be enabled if possible (sr started as root or
      with CAP_NET_RAW).
      udp4_raw can be used on Linux and FreeBSD. For other BSDs and Darwin
      one must compile with -DUSE_RAW_SOCKS.
      On Linux one should also set udp4_raw_mtu if the MTU on any network
      interface that could be used for sending is smaller then 1500.
      Can be set at runtime as long as sr was started with enough privileges
      (core.udp4_raw).
  - udp4_raw_mtu - MTU value used for UDP IPv4 packets when udp4_raw is
      enabled.  It should be set to the minimum MTU of all the network
      interfaces that could be used for sending. The default value is 1500.
      Note that on BSDs it does not need to be set (if set it will be ignored,
      the proper MTU will be used automatically by the kernel). On Linux it
      should be set.
      Can be set at runtime (core.udp4_raw_mtu).
  - udp4_raw_ttl - TTL value used for UDP IPv4 packets when udp4_raw is
      enabled. By default it is set to auto mode (-1), meaning that the
      same TTL will be used as for normal UDP sockets.
      Can be set at runtime (core.udp4_raw_ttl).
  - dst_blacklist_udp_imask - global blacklist events ignore mask for udp
    (a blacklist event/reason set in this variable will be ignored when 
    deciding whether or not to blacklist an udp destination). Can be set
    at runtime. Default: 0 (no blacklist reason is ignored).
    Possible values:  0 -disabled, 2 - send error; 4 - connect error,
                      8 - icmp (reserverd), 16 - transaction timeout,
                     32 - 503 received, 64 - administratively prohibited
                     (manually set).
   - dst_blacklist_tcp_imask - like dst_blacklist_udp_imask, but for tcp.
   - dst_blacklist_tls_imask - like dst_blacklist_tls_imask, but for tcp.
   - dst_blacklist_sctp_imask -like dst_blacklist_sctp_imask, but for tcp.
   - dns_cache_rec_pref - DNS cache record preference:
		0 - do not check duplicates (default)
		1 - prefer old records
		2 - prefer new records
		3 - prefer records with longer lifetime

modules:
   - counters: functions and RPCs for manipulating counters (statistics):
           modparam("counters", "script_counter", name)
           cnt_inc(name)
           cnt_add(name, val)
           cnt_reset(name)
   - blst: functions for ignoring blacklist events per message:
           blst_set_ignore(mask):  set the events in mask in the per
            per message blacklist ignore mask for a request
            (see dst_blacklist_udp_imask for possible values).
            The basic operation is: msg_blst_ignore_mask|=mask.
           blst_clear_ignore(mask): like blst_set_ignore(mask), but instead
            of setting some events, it clears them
            (msg_blst_ignore_mask&=~mask).
           blst_rpl_set_ignore(mask): like blst_set_ignore(mask), but sets
            the mask for possible local replies to the current message.
           blst_rpl_clear_ignore(mask): like blst_rpl_ignore(mask), but
            clears instead of setting.
   - tls:
          certificate revocation list (CRL) support.
          asynchronous TLS support
          new TLS RPCs (tls.info, tls.options), tls.list more detailed.
          removed handshake_timeout and send_timeout module parameters /
            config variables. The values from tcp are used instead
            (tcp_connect_timeout and tcp_send_timeout).
          runtime config support
          more config options:
            crl - certificate revocation list file path (PEM format).
            send_close_notify - enables/disables sending close notify
              alerts prior to closing the corresponding TCP connection.
              Sending the close notify prior to tcp shutdown is "nicer"
              from a TLS point of view, but it has a measurable
              performance impact. Default: off. Can be set at runtime
              (tls.send_close_notify).
            con_ct_wq_max - per connection tls maximum clear text write
              queue size.  The TLS clear-text write queues are used when a
              send attempt has to be delayed due to an on-going TLS level
              renegotiation. Can be set at runtime (tls.con_ct_wq_max).
              Default: 65536 (64 Kb).
            ct_wq_max - maximum total for all the tls clear text write
              queues (summed). Can be set at runtime (tls.ct_wq_max).
              Default: 10485760 (10 Mb).
            ct_wq_blk_size - internal TLS pre-write (clear-text) queue
              minimum block size (advance tunning or debugging).
              Can be set at runtime (tls.ct_wq_blk_size).
              Default: 4096 (4 Kb).
          verbose debug messages can be enable by re-compiling with
            -DTLS_RD_DEBUG (for the read path) and -DTLS_WR_DEBUG
            (for the write path).
          new options for better tuning memory usage for modern openssl
            versions: ssl_release_buffers (default 1), ssl_freelist_max_len
            (default 0), ssl_max_send_fragment, ssl_read_ahead (default 0).
            For more info see modules/doc/tls/README.
          compression is now disabled by default. To enable it set
            tls_disable_compression to 0, but note that memory usage will
            increase dramatically especially for large number of
            connections (>1000).
tm:
   - reason header support (RFC3326) both for CANCELs generated due to a
      received final reply and for hop by hop CANCELs generated because of a
      received CANCEL.
      E.g.: reason header added for a CANCEL generated after a 200 reply was
            received on one of the branches "Reason: SIP;cause=200".
      The reason header support can be turned on/off using either tm
      module parameters or in the end to end CANCEL case also on a per
      transaction basis, using a script function:
       local_cancel_reason = 0 | 1 (default 1/on) - turns on adding reason
         headers for CANCELs generated due to a final reply. Can be changed
         at runtime.
       e2e_cancel_reason = 0 | 1 (default 1/on) - turns on copying reason
         headers from a received end to end CANCEL (the generated hop by hop
         CANCELs will have the same reason headers as the received CANCEL).
         Can be changed at runtime.
       t_set_no_e2e_cancel_reason(0|1) - enable/disable cancel reason 
         header copying on a per transaction basis (0 - enable, 1 disable).
   - t_reply() can be used both from the main/core onreply_route{} and tm
     onreply_route[...]{}s.



sip-router 3.0 changes

core:
  - type casts operators: (int), (str).
  - new operators eq, ne for string compares and ieq, ine for interger 
    compares. The names are not yet final (use them at your own risk).
    Future version might use ==/!= only for ints (ieq/ine) and eq/ne for
    strings (under debate).
    They are almost equivalent to == or !=, but they force the conversion 
    of their operands (eq to string and ieq to int), allowing among other
    things better type checking on startup and more optimizations.
    Non equiv. examples: 0 == "" (true) is not equivalent to 0 eq ""
    (false: it evaluates to "0" eq ""). "a" ieq "b" (true: (int)"a" is 0
     and (int)"b" is 0) is not equivalent to "a" == "b" (false).
    Note: internally == and != are converted on startup to eq/ne/ieq/ine 
    whenever possible (both operand types can be safely determined at
    start time and they are the same).
  - try to guess what the user wanted when operators that support multiple
     types are used on different typed operands. In general convert the
     the right operand to the type of the left operand and then perform the
     operation. Exception: the left operand is undef.
     This applies to the following operators: +, == and !=.
     Special case: undef as left operand:
     For +: undef + expr -> undef is converted to string => "" + expr.
     For == and !=:   undef == expr -> undef is converted to type_of expr.
     If expr is undef, then undef == undef is true (internally is converted
     to string).
  - expression evaluation changes: auto-convert to interger or string
     in function of the operators: 
       int(undef)==0,  int("")==0, int("123")==123, int("abc")==0
       str(undef)=="", str(123)=="123".
  - new script operators: defined, strlen, strempty
      defined expr - returns true if expr is defined, and false if not.
                     Note: only a standalone avp or pvar can be
                     undefined, everything else is defined.
      strlen(expr) - returns the lenght of expr evaluated as string.
      strempty(expr) - returns true if expr evaluates to the empty
                       string (equivalent to expr=="").
    e.g.: if (defined $v && !strempty($v)) $len=strlen($v);
  - msg:len max_len comparison obsoleted and removed (it did not make any
    sense, msg:len > max_len was always false, use something like 
    4096 or 16384 in its place).
  - module search path support: loadpath takes now a list of directories
    separated by ':'. The list is searched in-order. For each directory d
    $d/${module_name}.so and $d/${module_name}/${module_name}.so are tried.
  - dns TXT, EBL and PTR support (both cache and non-cached resolver)
  - support for dual module interfaces: ser and kamailio
config script changes:
  - script mode can be switched between ser compatible, kamailio compatible
    and max compatibility (compatible with both as much as possible), using
      #!SER
      #!KAMAILIO
      #!OPENSER
      #!ALL
      #!MAXCOMPAT
    where #!KAMAILIO is equivalent with #!OPENSER and #!ALL with #!MAXCOMPAT
  - support for kamailio style pvars
  - C-like switch()/case (integer only)
  - while()
  - include file support: include_file "somefile"
  - event route support: event_route[module_name:eventid]
  - user and shm_force_alloc must now appear prior to any modparam() or route
     block.
  - per message send_flags support (see set_forward_no_connect(),
     set_forward_reply_no_connect(), set_forward_close() & set_reply_close())

build system:
  - multiple modules directories are now supported (defined in Makefile.dirs)

new config variables:
  - max_while_loops - maximum iterations allowed for a while  (can be changed
       at runtime). Default 100.
  - log_name - set the application name used when printing to syslog.
  - mem_summary - memory debugging info logged on exit or on SIGUSR1.
       The value is a combination of flags: 0 - off,
       1 - dump all used memory blocks and some statistics (lots of output),
       2 - dump a summary of the used memory blocks (works only if
           compiled with DBG_QM_MALLOC or DBG_F_MALLOC).
       Default: 1.
       Can be changed at runtime.
  - shm = number  or shm_mem = number  - size of shared memory in MB. It's
       overwritten if a value is specified on the command line (-m val).
       Default: 32 Mb. Must appear prior to any modparam() or route block.

new script commands:
  add_local_rport() - adds the rport parameter to the added via header
       (rfc3581).
  set_forward_no_connect() - the message will be forwarded only if there is
       already an existing connection to the destination (it applies only to
       connection oriented protocols like tcp, tls and in the future sctp).
  set_reply_no_connect() - like set_forward_no_connect(),  but works for
       replies to the current message.
  set_forward_close()  - try to close the connection after forwarding the
       current message (it applies only when the underlying protocol is
       connection oriented).
  set_reply_close() - like set_forward_close(), but it works for replies to
       the current message.

tm:
  disable_6xx_block parameter - if set, will treat 6xx replies like normal
       replies (non rfc conformant). Default: off.
       See also t_set_disable_6xx().
  t_set_disable_6xx(0|1) - can be used to turn off/on the special 6xx handling
       on a per transaction basis.
  t_set_disable_failover(0|1) - can be used to turn off/on dns failover on a
       per transaction basis.



2.1.0 changes

modules:
 - textops   - functions:
                        - remove_hf_re("regexp") -- filter message headers out
                          by matching the header name field against a regular
                          expression.
 - avp       - export new selects table to allow dissecting the content of an
               attribute by interpreting it as a "name-addr" value 
 - auth      - experimental support for one-time nonces: when enabled a nonce
               will be accepted only for one response (each new request will
               be challenged). See one_time_nonce.
             - experimental support for nc checking when qop=auth
               (fast, non-locking implementation, see nonce_count, 
                nc_array_size, nc_array_order and nid_pool_no) 
             - switched to base64 nonces
             - record nonce generation time inside the nonce so that a 
               received nonce can be checked against ser start time
               (if older => stale). This allows gracefully handling ser
               restarts with different auth configs.
             - added extra authentication checks support, to protect
               against various reply attacks.
             - params:
                       - nonce_auth_max_drift - maximum difference in seconds
                          from the current time, if a nonce appears to be
                          created in the future (if exceeded the nonce is 
                          considered stale).
                       - one_time_nonce - if enabled each nonce is allowed 
                          only once => each new request (including 
                          retransmissions!) will be challenged. It should be
                          used only in stateful mode (so that tm deals with
                          the retransmissions). The major disadvantage is that
                          the UA won't be able to used any cached credentials
                          (=> extra messages, extra round trips, more work for
                           the proxy)
                       - otn_in_flight_no - maximum number of in-flight nonces
                          for one-time-nonces. It must be a number of the form
                          2^k (if not it will be automatically rounded down).
                          The memory used will be otn_in_flight_no/8
                       - otn_in_flight_order - like otn_in_flight_no, but 
                          instead of specifying the number as 2^k, it directly
                          sets k (otn_in_flight_no=2^otn_in_flight_order)
                       - nonce_count - if enabled and qop=auth or 
                          qop=auth-int, store and check received nc values
                          (for details see rfc2617 and auth/doc). It should be
                          used only in stateful mode (so that tm deals with
                          the retransmissions which would otherwise be 
                          challenged). The major advantage is greatly 
                          enhanced security (extremely small probability of
                          a succesfull replay attack) combine with support
                          for cached credentials (if the UAs do support qop 
                          and auth)
                       - nc_array_size - size of the array used for storing
                          nc values, default 1Mb. It will be rounded down to
                          a 2^k value. It represents the maximum number of
                          in-flight nonces supported
                       - nc_array_order - equivalent to nc_array_size, but 
                          instead of specifying the size in bytes, it can 
                          be used to directly set the power of 2 used
                          (nc_array_size=2^nc_array_order)
                       - nid_pool_no - number of nc and one-time-nonce array 
                          and index partitions, useful for increasing 
                          performance on multi-cpu systems (default 1,
                          recommended 4)
                       - auth_checks_register, auth_checks_no_dlg, 
                         auth_checks_in_dlg - flags specifying which extra
                          message part/parts will be checked for change before
                          allowing nonce reuse. See the auth module docs for
                          for more information (modules/auth/README).
 - blst      - new module containing script blacklist manipulations functions
               (the source of a message can be blacklisted, removed from the
                blacklist or checked for presence in the blacklist).
 - tm        - added API function t_get_canceled_ident(): returns the hash 
               coordinates (bucket/index) of the transaction the currently 
               processed CANCEL is targeting. Requires AS support enabled.
             - added API function ack_local_uac(): allow generating the ACKs 
               for 2xx'ed locally originated INVITEs - new headers and body can
               now also be appended to it. Requires AS support enabled.
             - matching of E2E ACKs no longer requires full From HF identity,
               but rather only tag equality (this behaviour can be changed by
               defining TM_E2E_ACK_CHECK_FROM_URI)
             - added t_reset_fr(), t_reset_retr(), t_reset_max_lifetime()
             - t_relay_to renamed to t_relay_to_avp (undocumented function)
             - t_relay() can now also take host and port parameters (e.g.
               t_relay(host, port)), behaving like a statefull 
               forwad(host, port) version (forward to host:port using the same
               protocol on which the message was received)
             - t_relay_to_udp(), t_relay_to_tcp() and t_relay_to_tls() work
               now even with no parameters: in this case the message is 
               forwarded using the request uri, but with the specified protocol
               (equivalent to a t_relay() with a forced protocol)
             - method for canceling unreplied branches can now be selected
               using the new cancel_b_method tm parameter.
             - support for adding a 503 reply source to the blacklist for
               the time specified in the Retry-After header (see the new tm
               parameters blst_503, blst_503_def_timeout, blst_503_min_timeout
               and blst_503_max_timeout).
             - different error replies for too many branches (500 but with
               different text), resolve error (478) or send error
               (477).
             - tm can be configured not to automatically send 100 replies
               for invites either globally (see the auto_inv_100 parameter)
               or on a per transaction basis (see t_set_auto_inv_100(...))
             - t_relay* error reply are delayed till the end of the script
               to allow the script writer to overwrite them
             - branches are always canceled hop by hop
             - cancels for silently canceled branches (no replies ever 
               received) are automatically generated if later a provisional
               reply arrives on such a branch
             - noisy_ctimer is now 1 (on) by default
             - added maximum transaction lifetime - a transaction is not
               allowed to be active longer then this interval. See
               t_set_max_lifetime(), max_inv_lifetime and max_noninv_lifetime.
             - support for changing the retransmission intervals on the fly,
               on a per transaction basis (it is enabled if tm is compiled
               with -DTM_DIFF_RT_TIMEOUT -- default): t_set_retr(t1, t2).
             - transaction are deleted the moment they are not referenced 
               anymore (removed the need for the delete timer) -- this 
               should improve memory usage on very busy proxies.
             - lots of callbacks added
             - new onsend callbacks support (require defining TMCB_ONSEND prior
               to compiling tm)
             - behaviour when receiving a CANCEL which doesn't match any 
               transaction can be selected using the unmatched_cancel param.
             - params: 
                        - cancel_b_method - selects one of the three methods
                          for dealing with unreplied branches when the 
                          transaction must be canceled. The possible values
                          are 0 (old behaviour) for stopping request 
                          retransmission on the branch and act as if 
                          the branch was immediately replied with a 487,
                          1 for continuing to retransmit the request until an
                          answer is received or the timeout kicks in (default)
                          and
                          2 for stopping the request retransmission and sending
                          CANCEL on the branch (not rfc conforming).
                          For more information see tm docs.
                        - blst_503 - if set and if the blacklist is used
                          (use_dst_blacklist=1), add the source of a 503 reply
                          to the blacklist
                        - blst_503_def_timeout - if the Retry-After header from
                          a 503 reply is missing, use this value for the 
                          blacklist timeout (in s). Depends on blst_503.
                          The default value is 0 ( do not blacklist if no
                          Retry-After is present).
                        - blst_503_min_timeot (in s) - if the 503 reply 
                          Retry-After header value is less, use this value
                          for the blacklist timeout. Depends on blst_503.
                          The default value is 0.
                        - blst_503_max_timeout (in s) - if the 503 reply 
                          Retry-After header value is greater, use this value
                          instead. Depends on blst_503.
                          The default value is 3600 s.
                        - auto_inv_100 - if set (default) tm will automatically
                          send an 100 reply to INVITEs (see also 
                         t_set_auto_inv_100())
                        - noisy_ctimer is now 1 by default
                        - max_inv_lifetime & max_noninv_lifetime - default
                          maximum lifetimes for an invite or non-invite 
                          transaction. After this interval has passed from 
                          the transaction creation the transaction will be 
                          either switched into the wait state or in the
                          final response retransmission state => a transaction
                          will be kept in memory for maximum: 
                           max_*inv_lifetime + fr_timer /*ack w.*/ +wait_timer.
                        - unmatched_cancel - selects between forwarding cancels
                           that do not match any transaction statefully (0, 
                           default value), statelessly (1) or dropping them
                           (2). Note that the statefull forwarding has an 
                           additional hidden advantage: tm will be able to
                           recognize INVITEs that arrive after their CANCEL.
                           Note also that this feature could be used to try
                           a memory exhaustion DOS attack against a proxy that
                           authenticates all requests, by continuously flooding
                           the victim with CANCELs to random destinations 
                           (since the CANCEL cannot be authenticated, each
                           received bogus CANCEL will create a new transaction 
                           that will live by default 30s).
             - functions:
                        - t_reset_fr() -- resets the current transaction 
                          fr_inv_timer and fr_timer to the default values
                          (set via the tm modparams fr_inv_timer and fr_timer).
                        - t_reset_retr() -- resets the current transaction
                          retransmission intervals on the fly, to the default
                          values (set via the tm modparams retr_timer1 and 
                          retr_timer2).
                        - t_reset_max_lifetime() -- resets the current 
                          transaction maximum lifetime to the default value
                          (set via the tm  modparam max_inv_lifetime or 
                           max_noninv_lifetime).
                        - t_grep_status("code") -- returns true if any branch
                          received code as the final reply (or if no final 
                          reply was yet received, but a "code" provisional 
                          reply).
                        - t_set_auto_inv_100(on/off) - switch automatically
                          sending 100 replies to INVITEs on/off on a per
                          transaction basis. It overrides the tm param.
                          auto_inv_100.
                        - t_set_max_lifetime(inv, noninv) - changes the 
                          maximum transaction lifetime on the fly, for the
                          current or next to be created transaction.
                        - t_set_retr(t1, t2) - changes the retransmissions
                           intervals on the fly, on a per transaction basis.
core:
             - most tcp config vars migrated to the dynamic config framework
               (can be changed at runtime, e.g. 
                 sercmd cfg.set_now_int tcp connection_lifetime 180 )
             - fallback to tcp or other congestion controlled transport 
               protocol if a forwarded udp sip request is greater then 
               udp_mtu (config). Default off. See udp_mtu and 
               udp_mtu_try_proto.
             - sctp support (one-to-many, work in progress, for now linux
               and freebsd only)
             - partial cygwin (windows) support revived: core+static modules, 
               no ipv6, no tcp, no dynamic modules
             - most of the config variables can now be changed on the fly,
               without ser restart  (migration work in progress)
             - tcp improvements (better tcp timers, send fd cache, special
                options support)
             - dns naptr support (see dns_try_naptr and dns_<proto>_pref)
             - dns srv based load balancing support (see dns_srv_lb)
             - support for locking ser's pages in memory, pre-mapping
               all the shared memory on startup (fill it with 0)
             - real time options
             - devel: new PROC_INIT rank, init_child(PROC_INIT) called first
             - futex support on linux (better behaviour when waiting on 
               long held locks, almost no performance impact otherwise)
             - when dns search list was used for resolution, store the "link"
               between the short name and long name in cache as CNAME record

new config variables:
  tcp_rd_buf_size = buffer size used for tcp reads.
                    A high buffer size increases performance on server with few
                    connections and lot of traffic on them, but also increases
                     memory consumption (so for lots of connection is better 
                    to use a low value). Note also that this value limits the
                    maximum datagram size that can be received over tcp.
                    Default: 4096, can be changed at runtime.
  tcp_wq_blk_size = block size used for tcp async writes. It should be big
                    enough to hold a few datagrams. If it's smaller then a
                    datagram (in fact a tcp write()) size, it will be rounded
                    up. It has no influenced on the number of datagrams 
                    queued (for that see tcp_conn_wq_max or tcp_wq_max).
                    It has mostly debugging and testing value (can be ignored).
                    Default: 2100 (~ 2 INVITEs), can be changed at runtime.
  tcp_no_connect = yes/no - disable connects, ser will only accept new 
                     connections, it will never try to open new ones.
                     Default: no, can be changed at runtime.
  udp_mtu = number - fallback to another protocol (udp_mtu_try_proto must be
                     set also either globally or per packet) if the constructed
                     request size is greater then udp_mtu.
                     Recommended size: 1300. Default: 0 (off).
  udp_mtu_try_proto = TCP|TLS|SCTP|UDP - if udp_mtu !=0 and udp forwarded
                     request size (after adding all the "local" headers) >
                     udp_mtu, use this protocol instead of udp. Only the
                     Via header will be updated (e.g. The Record-Route
                     will be the one built for udp).
                     Default: UDP (off). Recommended: TCP.
  force_rport =yes/no - like force_rport(), but works globally.
  disable_sctp = yes/no - disable sctp support (default auto, see enable_sctp)
  enable_sctp = 0/1/2  - disable (0)/enable (1)/auto (2) sctp support, 
                         default auto (2)
  sctp_children = number - sctp children no (similar to udp children)
  sctp_socket_rcvbuf = number - size for the sctp socket receive buffer
  sctp_socket_sndbuf = number - size for the sctp socket send buffer
  sctp_autoclose = seconds - number of seconds before autoclosing an idle
                   association (default: 180 s).
                   Can be changed at runtime, but it will affect only new
                   associations. E.g.:
                   $ sercmd cfg.set_now_int sctp autoclose 120
  sctp_send_ttl = milliseconds - number of milliseconds before an unsent
                  message/chunk is dropped (default: 32000 ms or 32 s).
                  Can be changed at runtime, e.g.:
                  $ sercmd cfg.set_now_int sctp send_ttl 180000
  sctp_send_retries - how many times to attempt re-sending a message on a
                      re-opened association, if the sctp stack did give up
                      sending it (it's not related to sctp protocol level
                      retransmission). Useful to improve reliability with
                      peers that reboot/restart or fail over to another 
                      machine. WARNING: use with care and low values (e.g.
                      1-3) to avoid "multiplying" traffic to unresponding 
                      hosts (default: 0).
                      Can be changed at runtime.
  sctp_assoc_tracking = yes/no - controls whether or not sctp associations
     are tracked inside ser/sip-router. Turning it off would result in
     less memory being used and slightly better performance, but it will also
     disable some other features that depend on it (e.g. sctp_assoc_reuse).
     Default: yes.
     Can be changed at runtime (sercmd sctp assoc_tracking 0), but changes
     will be allowed only if all the other features that depend on it are
     turned off (for example it can be turned off only if first
     sctp_assoc_reuse was turned off).
     Note: turning sctp_assoc_tracking on/off will delete all the tracking
     information for all the currently tracked associations and might introduce
     a small temporary delay in the sctp processing if lots of associations
     were tracked.
     Config options depending on sctp_assoc_tracking being on:
      sctp_assoc_reuse.
  sctp_assoc_reuse = yes/no - controls sctp association reuse. For now only
     association reuse for replies is affected by it. Default: yes.
     Depends on sctp_assoc_tracking being on.
     Note that even if turned off, if the port in via corresponds to the
     source port of the association the request was sent on or if rport is
     turned on (force_rport() or via containing a rport option), the
     association will be automatically reused by the sctp stack.
     Can be changed at runtime (sctp assoc_reuse), but it can be turned on
     only if sctp_assoc_tracking is on.
  sctp_max_assocs = number - maximum number of allowed open sctp associations.
     -1 means maximum allowed by the OS. Default: -1.
     Can be changed at runtime (e.g.:
      sercmd cfg.set_now_int sctp max_assocs 10 ).
     When the maximum associations number is exceeded and a new associations
     is opened by a remote host, the association will be immediately closed.
     However it is possible that some sip packets get through (especially if
     they are sent early, as part of the 4-way handshake).
     When ser/sip-router tries to open a new association and the max_assocs
     is exceeded the exact behaviour depends on whether or not
     sctp_assoc_tracking is on. If on, the send triggering the active open
     will gracefully fail, before actually opening the new association and no
     packet will be sent. However if sctp_assoc_tracking is off, the
     association will first be opened and then immediately closed. In general
     this means that the initial sip packet will be sent (as part of the 4-way
     handshake).
  sctp_srto_initial = milliseconds - initial value of the retr. timeout, used
     in RTO calculations (default: OS specific).
     Can be changed at runtime (sctp srto_initial) but it will affect only new
     associations.
  sctp_srto_max = milliseconds - maximum value of the retransmission timeout
     (RTO) (default: OS specific).
     WARNING: values lower then the sctp sack_delay will cause lots of
     retransmissions and connection instability (see sctp_srto_min for more
     details).
     Can be changed at runtime (sctp srto_max) but it will affect only new
     associations.
  sctp_srto_min = milliseconds - minimum value of the retransmission timeout
     (RTO) (default: OS specific).
     WARNING: values lower then the sctp sack_delay of any peer might cause
     retransmissions and possible interoperability problems. According to the
     standard the sack_delay should be between 200 and 500 ms, so avoid trying
     values lower then 500 ms unless you control all the possible sctp peers
     and you do make sure their sack_delay is higher or their sack_freq is 1.
     Can be changed at runtime (sctp srto_min) but it will affect only new
     associations.
  sctp_asocmaxrxt   = number - maximum retransmissions attempts per association
     (default: OS specific). It should be set to sctp_pathmaxrxt * no. of
     expected paths.
     Can be changed at runtime (sctp asocmaxrxt) but it will affect only new
     associations.
  sctp_init_max_attempts = number - maximum INIT retransmission attempts
     (default: OS specific).
     Can be changed at runtime (sctp init_max_attempts).
  sctp_init_max_timeo = milliseconds - maximum INIT retransmission timeout (RTO
     max for INIT). Default: OS specific.
     Can be changed at runtime (sctp init_max_timeo).
  sctp_hbinterval = milliseconds - sctp heartbeat interval. Setting it to -1
     will disable the heartbeats. Default: OS specific.
     Can be changed at runtime (sctp hbinterval) but it will affect only new
     associations.
  sctp_pathmaxrxt = number - maximum retransmission attempts per path (see also
     sctp_asocmaxrxt). Default: OS specific.
     Can be changed at runtime (sctp pathmaxrxt) but it will affect only new
     associations.
  sctp_sack_delay = milliseconds - delay until an ACK is generated after
     receiving a packet. Default: OS specific.
     WARNING: a value higher then srto_min can cause a lot of retransmissions
     (and strange problems). A value higher then srto_max will result in very
     high connections instability. According to the standard the sack_delay
     value should be between 200 and 500 ms.
     Can be changed at runtime (sctp sack_delay) but it will affect only new
     associations.
  sctp_sack_freq = number - number of packets received before an ACK is sent
     (without waiting for the sack_delay to expire).  Default: OS specific.
     Note: on linux with lksctp up to and including 1.0.9 is not possible to
     set this value (having it in the config will produce a warning on
     startup).
     Can be changed at runtime (sctp sack_freq) but it will affect only new
     associations.
  sctp_max_burst = number - maximum burst of packets that can be emitted by an
     association. Default: OS specific.
     Can be changed at runtime (sctp max_burst) but it will affect only new 
     associations.
  server_id = number - A configurable unique server id that can be used to
                       discriminate server instances within a cluster of
                       servers when all other information, such as IP addresses
                       are the same.
  loadpath = <modules path> - directory where to load the modules from (-L
     equivalent); modules can be loaded simply by specifying their name
     (loadmodule "maxfwd")
  tcp_fd_cache = yes | no (default yes) - if enabled FDs used for sending
     will be cached inside the process calling tcp_send (performance increase
     for sending over tcp at the cost of slightly slower connection closing and
     extra FDs kept open)
  tcp_async = yes | no (default yes) - if enabled all the tcp  writes that 
     would block / wait for connect to finish, will be queued and attempted
     latter (see also tcp_conn_wq_max and tcp_wq_max).
  tcp_buf_write = obsoleted synonim for tcp_async
  tcp_conn_wq_max = bytes (default 32 K) - maximum bytes queued for write 
     allowed per connection. Attempting to queue more bytes would result
     in an error and in the connection being closed (too slow). If 
     tcp_write_buf is not enabled, it has no effect.
  tcp_wq_max = bytes (default 10 Mb) - maximum bytes queued for write allowed
     globally. It has no effect if tcp_write_buf is not enabled.
  tcp_defer_accept =  yes | no (default no) on freebsd  / number of seconds
        before timeout on linux (default disabled) - tcp accepts will be 
        delayed until some data is received (improves performance on proxies
        with lots of opened tcp connections). See linux tcp(7) TCP_DEFER_ACCEPT
        or freebsd ACCF_DATA(0). For now linux and freebsd only.
        WARNING: the  linux TCP_DEFER_ACCEPT is buggy (<=2.6.23) and doesn't 
         work exactly as expected (if no data is received it will retransmit 
         syn acks for ~ 190 s, irrespective of the set timeout and then it will
         silently drop the connection without sending a RST or FIN). Try to 
         use it together with tcp_syncnt (this way the number of retrans.
          SYNACKs can be limited => the timeout can be controlled in some way).
  tcp_delayed_ack  = yes | no (default yes when supported) - initial ACK for
        opened connections will be delayed and sent with the first data
        segment (see linux tcp(7) TCP_QUICKACK). For now linux only.
  tcp_syncnt = number of syn retr. (default not set) - number of SYN 
        retransmissions before aborting a connect attempt (see linux tcp(7)
        TCP_SYNCNT). Linux only.
  tcp_linger2 = seconds (not set by default) - lifetime of orphaned sockets
        in FIN_WAIT2 state (overrides tcp_fin_timeout on, see linux tcp(7) 
        TCP_LINGER2). Linux only.
  tcp_keepalive = yes | no (default yes) - enables keepalive for tcp.
  tcp_keepidle  = seconds (not set by default) - time before starting to send
         keepalives, if the connection is idle. Linux only.
  tcp_keepintvl = seconds (not set by default) - time interval between 
         keepalive probes, when the previous probe failed. Linux only.
  tcp_keepcnt = number (not set by default) - number of keepalives sent before
         dropping the connection. Linux only.
  tcp_crlf_ping = yes | no (set by default) - enable CRLF keepalives aka
         SIP outbound.
  pmtu_discovery = 0 | 1 (default 0) - set DF bit in outbound IP if enabled
  dns_srv_lb = yes | no (default no) - enable dns srv weight based load 
    balancing (see doc/dns.txt)
  dns_try_naptr = yes | no (default no) - enable naptr support 
    (see doc/dns.txt for more info)
  dns_{udp,tcp,tls,sctp}_pref = number - ser preference for each protocol
    when doing naptr lookups. By default dns_udp_pref=30, dns_tcp_pref=20, 
    dns_tls_pref=10 and dns_sctp_pref=20. To use the remote site preferences
    set all dns_*_pref to the same positive value (e.g. dns_udp_pref=1,
    dns_tcp_pref=1, dns_tls_pref=1, dns_sctp_pref=1). To completely ignore 
    NAPTR records for a specific protocol, set the corresponding protocol 
    preference to -1 (or any other negative number).  (see doc/dns.txt for 
    more info)
  dns_search_full_match = yes | no (default yes) - when name was resolved 
    using dns search list, check the domain added in the answer matches with
    one from the search list (small performance hit, but more safe)
  mlock_pages = yes |no (default no) - locks all ser pages into memory making 
    it unswappable (in general one doesn't want his sip proxy swapped out :-))
  shm_force_alloc = yes | no (default no) - tries to pre-fault all the 
    shared memory, before starting. When on start time will increase, but
    combined with mlock_pages will guarantee ser will get all its memory from
    the beginning (no more kswapd slow downs)
  real_time = <int> (flags) (default off). - sets real time priority
     for all the ser processes, or the timers. 
     Possible values:   0  - off
                        1  - the "fast" timer
                        2  - the "slow" timer
                        4  - all processes, except the timers
     Example: real_time= 7 => everything switched to real time priority.
  rt_prio = <int> (default 0) - real time priority used for everything except
     the timers, if real_time is enabled
  rt_policy= <0..3> (default 0)- real time scheduling policy, 0 = SCHED_OTHER,
     1= SCHED_RR and 2=SCHED_FIFO
  rt_timer1_prio=<int> (default 0) - like rt_prio but for the "fast" timer
     process (if real_time & 1)
  rt_timer1_policy=<0..3> (default 0) - like rt_policy but for the "fast" timer
  rt_timer2_prio=<int> (default 0) - like rt_prio but for the "slow" timer
  rt_timer2_policy=<0..3> (default 0) - like rt_policy but for the "slow" timer
  tcp_source_ipv4 = IPv4 address
  tcp_source_ipv6 = IPv6 address
    Set the given source IP for all outbound TCP connections.
    If setting the IP fails the TCP connection will use the default.
  dns_cache_init = on | off (default on) - if off, the dns cache is not
    initialized at startup and cannot be enabled runtime, that saves some
    memory.
  dst_blacklist_init = on | off (default on) - if off, the blacklist
    is not initialized at startup and cannot be enabled runtime,
    that saves some memory.

new script commands:
  udp_mtu_try_proto(TCP|TLS|SCTP|UDP) - same as udp_mtu_try_proto=... (see
    above), but works per packet and not globally.


build system:
 - check defines and includes used at compile time and if different 
   force rebuilding everything in the current dir (creates a new file: 
   makecfg.lst that stores the compile defines & includes used at compile 
   time)
 - make cfg / config support: store the build config in an autogenerated file 
   (config.mak) and use it for future compiles (e.g.: 
   make cfg include_modules=mysql skip_modules=print CPU=pentium-m; make all).
   Main advantages are easier usage and faster builds (e.g. make proper is
    +16 times faster, make clean ~9 times, make with previously generated
    config is 2.6 times faster and a make that has nothing to do is ~9 times
    faster).




2.0.0 changes


new archs:


modules:
 - tls        - new module that enables tls support (set enable_tls=yes
                in the config file and load the tls module)
 - ctl        - new  fifo/unixsocket/xmlrpc like module, using a space 
                efficient binary encoding for the requests.
                It supports multiple clients on tcp, udp, unix stream or
                unix datagram modes. By default (no modparams) it opens
                one unix stream control socket in /tmp/ser_ctl.
                It also includes extended fifo support: multiple fifos,
                fifo over tcp, udp and unix sockets (see ctl/ctl.cfg).
                Use utils/sercmd/sercmd to send commands to it.
 - dispatcher - added hashing after request uri and to uri
              - added a new flag parameter which can be used (for now) to
                select only the username or the username, host and port when
                hashing after an uri (to, from or request uri)
              - improved uri hashing (password is ignored, port is used only
                if != 5060 or 5061)
 - tm        - aggregate challenges (WWW/Proxy-Authenticate) from all the
               401 & 407 if the final reply is a 401/407. To turn this off
               and fall back to the old behaviour set tm aggregate_challenges
               parameter to 0.
             - if a relayed 503 is the final reply, replace it by a 500
             - if a 503 reply is received try the dns based failover
               (forward to another ip if the original destination uri 
                resolved to several SRV, A or AAAA records)
             - on 6xx immediately cancel all the branches for which a 
               provisional response was received and wait for all the 
               branches to finish (either timeout, the 487 from the CANCEL
               or a final response still on the wire in the moment the
               CANCEL was sent)
             - better final reply selection: 6xx is preferred over other 
               negative replies; from several 4xx prefer 401, 407, 415, 420,
               484 (in this order). For all the other cases, return the lowest
               code (as before)
             - special functions for checking for timeout, if a reply was
               received or if the current transaction was canceled
             - dns failover and dst blacklist support
             - migrated to the new timers (tm timers completely rewritten)
             - improved speed and less memory usage
             - much more precise retransmissions timing
             - params: - retr_timer1p1, retr_timer1p2, retr_timer1p3 removed
                         and replaced by retr_timer1 and retr_timer2
                       - all timer values are now expressed in milliseconds
                         (they were in seconds before).
                         Affected params: fr_timer, fr_inv_timer, wt_timer,
                         delete_timer, retr_timer1, retr_timer2
                       - retr_timer1 (first retransmission) changed to 500 ms
                       - delete_timer changed to 200 ms
                       - unix_tx_timeout expressed now in milliseconds; default
                         value changed to 500 ms
             - functions:
                       - t_branch_timeout() -- returns true if the failure
                         route is executed for a branch that did timeout
                         (failure_route only).
                       - t_branch_replied() -- returns true if the failure 
                         route is executed for a branch that did receive at
                         least one reply in the past (the current reply 
                          is not taken into account). It can be used
                         together with t_branch_timeout() to distinguish 
                         between a remote side that doesn't respond (some 
                         provisional reply received) and one that is completely
                          dead. (failure_route only)
                       - t_any_timeout() -- returns true if any of the current
                         transaction branches did timeout.
                       - t_any_replied() -- returns true if at least one branch
                          of the current transaction received one reply in the
                          past. If called from a failure_route or an
                          onreply_route, the "current" reply is not taken into
                          account.
                       - t_is_canceled() -- returns true if the current 
                         transaction  has been canceled.
                       - new t_set_fr(timeout_fr_inv, timeout_fr) -- allows
                         changing the transaction timer from script, even if
                         the transaction was already created (see tm docs for
                         more).
            - t_relay will not stop script execution anymore in case of
              send error
 - textops  - search() can be used in the onsend_route where it will search
              on the "new" message (after applying all script changes, adding
              Vias a.s.o) and not on the original message
 
core:
 - compiled by default with tls hooks support (so that no recompile is
   needed before loading the tls module and enabling the tls support)
 -  enable_tls config option added (the reverse of disable_tls)
 - added STUN keep-alive functionality in accordance with 
   draft-ietf-behave-rfc3489bis-04.txt
 - dns cache and dns failover support added (see doc/dns.txt)
 - destination blacklist added -- destinations to which forwarding fails
   (send error, tm timeout a.s.o) are temporarily added to a blacklist which 
    is consulted before each send => faster send error detection
    in the near future (see doc/dst_blacklist.txt)
 - default log level switched to 0 (only messages < L_WARN will be printed
   by default)
 - separate memdbg log level which controls the memory/malloc related
   debug messages (to see them ser must be compiled with malloc debuging:
     -DDBG_QM_MALLOC or -DDBG_FM_MALLOC and memdbg must be <= debug )
 - added named routes: names can be used instead of numbers in all the
   route commads or route declarations. route(number) is equivalent to
   route("number").
   Example:
     route("test");
      route["test"]{
           ...
     }
 - added named flags, declared at the beginning of the config file with:
     flags  flag1_name[:position],  flag2_name ...
   Example:
       flags test, a:1, b:2 ;
       route{
              setflag(test);
              if (isflagset(a)){ # equiv. to isflagset(1)
                ....
              }
              resetflag(b);  # equiv. to resetflag(2) 
 - added return [val] which returns from a route. if no value is specified, or
   a route reaches its end without executing a return statement, it returns 1.
   If return is used in the top level route is equivalent with exit [val].
 - drop /exit [n] now will end the script execution
   exit n will exit with code n (usefull in onreply/onsend routes where
   if script code !=0 a reply is generated/the message is sent or to force
   script errors)
 - added $? which can be used to check the return code of the last executed
   route{} (e.g. route(1); if ($?==1){ /* ... */}else if ($?==2) ... )
 - onsend_route added: special route executed before a request is sent.
                       Only a limited number of commands are allowed (drop, if
                       + all the checks, msg flag manipulations, send(), log(),
                       textops::search()). In this route the final destination
                       of the message is available an can be checked (with
                       snd_ip, snd_port, to_ip, to_port, snd_proto, snd_af).
                       This route is executed only when forwarding requests.
                       It's not executed for replies, retransmissions, or
                       locally generated messages (e.g. via fifo uac).
      short example:
            onsend_route{  if(to_ip==1.2.3.4 && !isflagset(12)){
                              log(1, "message blocked\n");
                              drop;
                           }
                         }
 - onsend_route specific checks:
     - snd_ip, snd_port - behave like src_ip/src_port, but contain the
       ip/port ser will use to send the message
     - to_ip, to_port - like above, but contain the ip/port the message will
       be sent to (not to be confused with dst_ip/dst-port, which are the
       destination of the original message: ser's ip and port on which the
       message was received)
     - snd_proto, snd_af - behave like proto/af but contain the 
       protocol/address family that ser will use to send the message
     - msg:len - when used in an onsend_route, msg:len will contain the length
       of the message on the wire (after all the changes in the script are
       applied, Vias are added a.s.o) and not the lentgh of the original 
       message
 - timer: - improved performance/precision, new api, see doc/timers.txt 
 - tcp: - improved  performance (io event handling), using OS specific
           optimizations
        - 1024 connections limit removed (see tcp_max_connections)
-  resolver: - timeouts, retries a.s.o can now be set from ser.cfg
             (see below dns_* and man resolv.conf(6)).
             The maximum time a dns request can take (before failing) is:
              (dns_retr_time*dns_retr_no)*(search_list_domains)
             If dns_try_ipv6 is yes, mutliply it again by 2.
             The fastest possible dns config (max 1s):
                dns_try_ipv6=no
                dns_retr_time=1
                dns_retr_no=1
                dns_use_search_list=no
- default on reply route added: onreply_route {.. } will add a default 
    onreply route that will be executed for any reply (usefull to catch
    replies without using tm)
- branch_routes added (tm triggered), only a very limited number of commands
   are available (see tm docs)
- avps directly accessible from script with %avp_name (variable style)
new config variables:
   enable_tls/disable_tls = enable/disable tls support, default disable.
       Note: a tls "engine" is still needed (e.g. the tls module must
              be loaded, enable_tls by itself is not enough).
   exit_timeout = seconds - how much time ser will wait for all the shutdown
       procedures to complete. If this time is exceeded, all the remaining
       processes are immediately killed and ser exits immediately (it might
       also generate a core dump if the cleanup part takes too long).
       Default: 60 s. Use 0 to disable.
   stun_refresh_interval = number in millisecond (default 0); value for 
      attribute REFRESH INTERVAL
   stun_allow_stun = 0 | 1 (off | on - default 1); use STUN or not if compiled
   stun_allow_fp = 0 | 1 (off | on - default 1); use FINGERPRINT attribute
   use_dns_cache = on | off  (default on)  
   use_dns_failover = on | off (default off)
   dns_cache_flags = number (default 0)
   dns_cache_negative_ttl = number in seconds (default 60)
   dns_cache_min_ttl = time in seconds (default 0)
   dns_cache_max_ttl = time in seconds (default MAXINT)
   dns_cache_mem = maximum memory used for the dns cache in Kb (default 500 K)
   dns_cache_gc_interval = interval in seconds after which the dns cache is
      garbage collected (default: 120 s)
   use_dst_blacklist = on | off (default off)
   dst_blacklist_expire = time in s (default 60)
   dst_blacklist_mem = maximum memory used for the blacklist in Kb (default 250
      K)
   dst_blacklist_gc_interval = interval in seconds after which the destination 
      blacklist is garbage collected (default 60)
   tos = number  - ip type of service (TOS) value
   dns_try_ipv6 = yes/no - if yes and a dns lookup fails, it will retry it
      for ipv6 (AAAA record). Default: yes
   dns_retr_time = time - time in s before retrying a dns request.
      Default: system specific, depends also on the/etc/resolv.conf content
      (usually 5s).
   dns_retr_no = no. - number of dns retransmissions before giving up.
      Default: see above (usually 4)
   dns_servers_no = no. - how many dns servers from the ones defined in 
      /etc/resolv.conf will be used. Default: all of them.
   dns_use_search_list= yes/no - if no, the search list in /etc/resolv.conf
      will be ignored (=> fewer lookups => gives up faster). Default: yes.
      HINT: even if you don't have a search list defined, setting this option
      to "no" will still be "faster", because an empty search list is in 
      fact search "" (so even if the search list is empty/missing there will
      still be 2 dns queries, eg. foo+'.' and foo+""+'.')
   tcp_connection_lifetime = value (s) - how long the lifetime of a
      tcp connection will be exteneded after an IO event (accept, connect, 
      read, write). Default: 120 s.
   tcp_poll_method = poll|select|sigio_rt|epoll_et|epoll-lt|kqueue|devpoll - 
      poll method used (by default the best one for the current OS is selected)
   tcp_max_connections = no. - maximum number of tcp connections (if the number
      is exceeded no new tcp connections will be accepted). Default: 2048.

tools:
  utils/sercmd - command line serctl like tool for interrogating ser ctl
                 module (uses the binrpc encoding). Supports various
                 connection methods (udp, tcp, unix stream & datagram sockets),
                 reply formating (see -f, e.g. sercmd -f "pid:%v %v\n" core.ps)
                 , interactive mode, command line completion (if compiled with 
                 libreadline) a.s.o.

WARNING: - older 0.10.99-dev version (< 0.10.99-dev46) returned a 480 reply
 on invite transaction timeout, if a provisional reply was received. Newer
 versions reverted to returning 408 on all timeouts (one can use 
  t_branch_timeout() and t_branch_replied() to distinguish between the two
  timeout types)

0.9.3 changes


new archs:
 - alpha experimental support
 - mips2/cobalt experimental support
 - x86_64 support
 - OS X (darwin) support
 - sparc32 single cpu highly experimental support
 - ppc64 support

modules:
 - enum - support for more than one NAPTR
 - msilo - explicit multidomain support -- recipient's user ID is stored in
   the columns username and domain -- r_uri column kept for compatibility
   reasons (will be removed in future) but not filled by this version of
   module
 - mysql - implements a connection pool, all modules will use same connection
   to access the database
 - nathelper received port  test (flag 16 for nat_uac_test): compares the
   source port of the message with sip port in the first Via and returns
   true if different.
 - permsions - support for multiple allow/deny files, allow_register function
 - TM has a new parameter: restart_fr_on_each_reply. If set (default)
   fr_inv timer will be restarted for each provisional reply, if not set
   it will be restarted only for the first reply and for replies >=180
   (but only if increasing, eg.: 180, 181 ...). Usefull when dealing with bad
   UAs that re-transmit 180s.
 - TM saves the avp list into transactions, and make it available into
   callbacks, failure and reply routes.
 - TM contains new command - t_write_unix("/tmp/sems.sock", "announcement")
   sends a message using unix socket interface instead of FIFO interface.
 - TM contains new config variable - unix_tx_timeout -- it specifies the
   transmit timeout of t_write_sock
 - VM functionality was transfered into TM module. Instead of fetching the
   email value from DB (as VM), TM looks for the "email" attribute to get the
   value.
   vm() function was replaced with t_write_req()
   vm_reply() fifo functions was replcated by TM with t_reply() fifo function
   NOTE!! because current version of SEMS/AA try to send reply via vm_reply,
   it will not work with the TM version.
 - xlog - printing the body of any header by specifying the name; new
   specifiers for user-agent, message buffer, message length, message's flags,
   message id.

new modules:
 - avp / avp_db / avp_radius - load and check avps per caller or callee
 - avpops - flexible module for operations with avps and database, introducing
   a pseudo-varible support in SER configuration file
 - cpl-c - implementation of Call Processing Language
 - dispatcher - implements a dispatcher for incoming requests using hashes
   over parts of the request to select the destination
 - diversion - implements the Diversion extensions as per 
   draft-levy-sip-diversion-08
 - flatstore - simple module that implements very fast inserts for accounting
   purposes
 - gflags - keeps a bitmap of flags in shared memory and may be used to change
   behaviour of server based on value of the flags
 - options - answer server options requests
 - speeddial - provides on-server speed dial facilities
 - uri_db - split from uri module, performs various checks related to SIP URI
   over database fields

removed modules:
 - vm - the functionality was transfered to tm module (see t_write_req(...)
   method)

core:
 - new parts:
       UNIX domain socket server implemented
 - changes: 
    - command line: removed -p port and extended -l:
       -l [proto:]addr[:port] , where proto=udp|tcp and 
       addr= host|ip_address|interface_name. The format is the same
       as for listen in the config file. ipv6 addresses must be enclosed in
       [].
    - added from_uri & to_uri: behave exactly like uri but use the
      "From:"/"To:" uris
       (e.g.: if (from_uri==myself) ..., if (to_uri=~"^sip:test@")... )
    - config: better escape support in strings (e.g. \", \<cr>, \x0a, \012)
    - bad network addresses are now automatically fixed
      (e.g. 192.168.1.80/27 => 192.168.1.64/27)
    - avp (Attribute-Value Pair) support added
    - avp alias support added
    - multicast support added (see mcast_loopback & mcast_ttl)
    - saving of procces group id enabled, if the -G option is specified
      (a safe way to quickly kill all ser processes)
    - core dump-ing is enabled by default, see also disable_core_dump
    - protocol and port can be specified in the alias and listen lines, e.g.:
        alias= tcp:foo.bar:* udp:test.bar:5080 foo.com
        listen= eth0   tcp:eth0:5065 udp:127.0.0.1 [3ffe::1]
    - multiple operator support: ==, != for special operations (e.g myself, ip)
                              ==, !=, ~= for strings
                              ==, !=, >, <, >=, <= for integers
    - database api changed to support usage of different drivers
      simultaneously. The database URL must start now with the name of the
      driver (module). Example: for mysql the DB URL
      'sql://user:password@dbhost:port/database' must be specified now as
      'mysql://user:password@dbhost:port/database'
 - new config variables:
   mcast_loopback = <yes/no> - loopback sent multicast datagram, default no.
   mcast_ttl = number - set multicast ttl, default OS specific (usually 1).
   sock_mode = <permissions> (e.g. sock_mode=0600:  default value = 0660)
       ser unix sockets and fifo will be created with this permissions
       (old name fifo_mode is still supported, but deprecated)
   sock_user = username|"uid"
   sock_group = groupname|"gid"
      change the owner and/or group of the ser unix sockets or fifo
      Short example config snippet:
           sock_mode=0600        # ser socket/fifo mode
           sock_user="www-data"  # ser socket/fifo owner
           sock_group=nogroup  
           user=nobody       # ser user (ser will suid to it)
   disable_core_dump= yes|no 
       by default core dump limits are set to unlimited or a high enough
       value, set this config variable o yes to disable core dump-ing
       (will set core limits to 0)
   open_files_limit= number
       if set and bigger than the current open file limit, ser will try
       to increase its open file limit to this number. Note: ser must be
       started as root to be able to increase a limit past the hard limit
       (which, for open files, is 1024 on most systems)
   tcp_connect_timeout= seconds
       time before an ongoing connect will be aborted
   tcp_send_timeout= seconds
       time after a tcp connection will be closed if it is not available 
       for writing in this interval (and ser wants to send something on it)
   tcp_accept_aliases= yes|no
       if a message received over a tcp connection has "alias" in its via
       a new tcp alias port will be created for the connection the message
       came from (the alias port will be set to the via one).
       Based on draft-ietf-sip-connect-reuse-00.txt, but using only the port
       (host aliases are too dangerous IMHO, involve extra DNS
        lookups and the need for them is questionable)
       See force_tcp_alias for more details.
   log_facility = LOG_LOCAL0
       if ser logs to syslog, you can control the facility for logging. Very
       useful when you want to divert all ser logs to a different log file.
       See man page syslog(3) for more detailes.
   unix_sock = "/tmp/ser.sock"
       The name of the socket the unixsock server should listen on.
   unix_sock_children = 1
       The number of children that will listen on the unix domain socket.
   unix_tx_timeout = 2000
       Timeout (in ms) used when sending replies through unix sockets.
 - new script commands:
   force_send_socket([proto:]address[:port])
       sends the message from the specified socket (it _must_ be one of the
       sockets ser listens on). If the protocol doesn't match (e.g. udp
       message "forced" to a tcp socket) the closest socket of the same
       protocol is used.
   force_tcp_alias()
   force_tcp_alias(port)
       adds a tcp port alias for the current connection (if tcp).
       Usefull if you want to send all the trafic to port_alias through
       the same connection this request came from [it could help 
       for firewall or nat traversal].
       With no parameters adds the port from the message via as the alias.
       When the "aliased" connection is closed (e.g. it's idle for too
       much time), all the port aliases are removed.
       Note: by default ser closes idle connection after 3 minutes (stable)
       or 1 minute (unstable) so to take full advantage of tcp aliases for
       things like firewall and nat traversal, redefine TCP_CON_*TIMEOUT
       in tcp_conn.h and recompile. Also right now there can be maximum
       3 port aliases to a connection (you shouldn't need more than one).
       To change this redefine TCP_CON_MAX_ALIASES in the same file
       (set it to you desired value + 1; 1 is needed for the real port).

utilities:
 - ngrep patch for displaying new lines in captured SIP messages is no longer
   needed; use ngrep V 1.42 with the option "-W byline"



***********************************************
* Changes/fixes introduced in 0.8.12
***********************************************
+--------------------------------------------------------+
| WARNING: if you want to use a 0.8.11 config script     |
| with 0.8.12, replace if ( len_gt(number) ) with:       |
|                      if ( msg:len > bumber )           |
+--------------------------------------------------------+

New Features
============

texops:
 - subst('s/re/repl/flags') support
core:
 - added switch to check the config file (-c)
 - changes: removed len_gt() and replaced with if (msg:len op number|max_len)
 - multiple operator support: ==, != for special operations (e.g myself, ip)
                              ==, !=, ~= for strings
                              ==, !=, >, <, >=, <= for integers
 - new config variables:
     advertised_address= ip | string
       address advertised in via and in the DST_* lumps (e.g RR)
       This is the default value, if empty (default) the socket
       address will be used.
       WARNING: - don't set it unless you know what you are doing
                 (e.g. nat traversal)
               - you can set anything here, no check is made
                (e.g. foo.bar will be accepted even if 
                 foo.bar doesn't exist)
    advertised_port= no
       port advertised in via and in the DST_*lumps (e.g. RR)
       This is the default value, if empty (default) the socket
       port will be used.
       Same warnings as above.
 - new script commands:
    set_advertised_address(ip|string)
       same as advertised_address but it affects only the current message:
       Message host/lump address= the set_advertised one if
       present, else advertised_address else socket address.
    set_advertised_port(no)
       same as advertised_port but it affects only the current
       message; see set_advertised_address & s/address/port/g

  user@domain and calculate_ha1 was set to yes (modules/auth_db)
- tm reply processing race condition (modules/tm), special thanks go to
 Dong Liu
- Many bugs in pa module fixed, works with registrar again.
 
Security updates
================
 
- fifo processing code will write responses only to other
 fifos and only if they are not hard-linked, also default
 ser fifo persmissions were changed to 0600.

Changes to use of ser scripts
=============================

About Multiple Transport Support
--------------------------------
SER now suports multiple transport protocols: UDP and TCP. As there
may be UAs which support only either protocol and cannot speak to
each other directly, we recommend to alway record-route SIP requests,
to keep the transport-translating SER in path. Also, if a destination
transport is not known, stateful forwarding is recommended -- use of
stateless forwarding for TCP2UDP would result in loss of reliability.


core
----
- reply_route has been renamed to failure_route -- the old name caused
  too much confusion
- forward_tcp and forward_udp can force SER to forward via specific
  transport protocol

acc module:
-----------
- radius and sql support integrated in this module; you need to
  recompile to enable it
- acc_flag is now called log_flag to better reflect it relates
  to the syslog mode (as opposed to sql/radius); for the same
  reasons, the accounting action is now called "acc_log_request"
  and the option for missed calls "log_missed_calls"
- log_fmt allows now to specify what will be printed to syslog

auth module:
------------
- auth module has been split in auth, auth_db, auth_radius, group
  group_radius, uri and uri_radius 
- all the parameters that were part of former auth module are now 
  part of auth_db module
- auth_db module contains all functions needed for database
  authentication
- auth_radius contains functions needed for radius authentication
- group module contains group membership checking functions
- group_radius contains radius group membeship checking functions
- is_in_group has been renamed to is_user_in and places to groups
  module
- check_to and check_from have been moved to the uri module
 

im module:
----------
- im is no longer used and has been obsoleted by TM

exec module:
------------
- exec_uri and exec_user have been obsoleted by exec_dset; 
  exec_dset is identical to exec_uri in capabilities; it 
  additionaly passes content of request elements (header 
  fields and URI parts) in environment variables; users of 
  exec_user can use exec_dset now and use the "URI_USER"  
  variable to learn user part of URI
- exec_dset and exec_msg return false, if return value of 
  script does not euqal zero
- exec_dset takes an additional parameter, which enables 
  validation of SIP URIs returned by external application

jabber module:
--------------
- presence support for Jabber users is enabled loading the PA
  module and using handle_subscribe("jabber") for SUBSCRIBE 
  requests to jabber user 

msilo module:
-------------
- m_store has now a parameter to set what should be considered
  for storing as destination uri. This enables support for saving
  the messages on negative replies.

radius_acc module:
------------------
- radius_acc module has been removed and radius accounting 
  is now part of acc module

registrar/usrloc modules:
-------------------------
- multi domain support, the modules user username@domain as AOR
  if enabled
- descent modification time ordering of contacts
- case sensitive/insensitive comparison of URI can be enabled

rr module:
----------
- addRecordRoute has been replaced with record_route
- rewriteFromRoute has been replaced with loose_route()
- a new option, "enable_full_lr" can be set to make life
  with misimplemented UAs easier and put LR in from "lr=on"
- rr module can insert two Record-Route header fields when
  necesarry (disconnected networks, UDP->TCP and so on)

tm module:
----------
- t_reply_unsafe, used in former versions within reply_routes,
  is deprecated; now t_reply is used from any places in script
- t_on_negative is renamed to t_on_failure -- the old name just
  caused too much confusion
- FIFO t_uac used by some applications (like serweb) has been
  replaced with t_uac_dlg (which allows easier use by dialog-
  oriented applications, like click-to-dial) 
- if you wish to do forward to another destination from 
  failure_route (reply_route formerly), you need to call t_relay
  or t_relay_to explicitely now
- t_relay_to has been replaced with t_relay_to_udp and t_relay_to_tcp
