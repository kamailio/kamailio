Description: very fast, dynamic and configurable SIP server
 Kamailio is a very fast and flexible SIP (RFC3261)
 server. Written entirely in C, kamailio can handle thousands requests
 per second even on low-budget hardware. It can be configured to act
 as a SIP proxy, application server, session border controller,
 or call load balancer to handle a set of media servers.
 .
 A C Shell like scripting language provides full control over the server's
 behaviour. It's easy to integrate Kamailio with 3rd party API's and applications
 using HTTP, AMQP, database drivers, LDAP, Radius and many other solutions.
 In addition there is support for scripting using Lua, Python, Perl, Java and
 a set of other languages using Mono.
 .
 Kamailio's modular architecture allows only required functionality to be loaded.
 There are over 100 modules available: WebSockets for WebRTC, authentication,
 multiple databases - both traditional SQL databases as well as no-SQL,
 message bus systems like Rabbit MQ, instant messaging, a presence agent,
 integration with REST-ful APIs using HTTP and JSON or XML,
 radius authentication, record routing, an SMS gateway, a XMPP/jabber gateway, a
 transaction and dialog module, OSP module, statistics support,
 registrar and user location services, SNMP, SIMPLE Presence and much more.
 .
 This package contains the main Kamailio binary along with the principal modules
 and support binaries.
