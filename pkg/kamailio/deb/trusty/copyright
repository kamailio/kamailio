Comment: Note that md5.c and md5.h have been replaced in the patches
 plum_md5*.patch .
 .
 As for md5utils.c, according to a mail from Upstream (Daniel-Constantin
 Mierla): while the initial commit log for it states that it is derived
 from mddriver.c of RFC 1321, it seems that it was, in fact, written from
 scratch by Jiri Kuthan (a core developer of SER at that time, working for
 FhG Fokus Institute). As you can see it's rather trivial and uses a data
 type of SER ("str").  I didn't reimplement it as it's too trivial and
 looks like there's no other way to implement it.
