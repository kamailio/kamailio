    <title>The Server Startup</title>
    <para>
	The <function>main</function> function in file
	<filename>main.c</filename> is the first function called upon server
	startup. It's purpose is to initialize the server and enter main
	loop. The server initialization will be described in the following
	sections.
    </para>
    
    <para>
	Particular initialization steps are described in order in which they

    <section id="signal_handlers">
	<title>Installation Of New Signal Handlers</title>
	<para>
	    The first step in the initialization process is the installation of
	    new signal handlers. We need our own signal handlers to be able to
	    do graceful shutdown, print server statistics and so on. There is
	    only one signal handler function which is function
	    <function>sig_usr</function> in file <filename>main.c</filename>.
	</para>
	<para>
	    The following signals are handled by the function: SIGINT, SIGPIPE,
	    SIGUSR1, SIGCHLD, SIGTERM, SIGHUP and SIGUSR2.

	<title>Parser Initialization</title>
	<para>
	    SER contains a fast 32-bit parser. The parser uses pre-calculated
	    hash table that needs to be filled in upon startup. The
	    initialization is done here, there are two functions that do the
	    job. Function <function>init_hfname_parser</function> initializes
	    hash table in header field name parser and function
	    <function>init_digest_parser</function> initializes hash table in

	    To make SER even faster we decided to re-implement memory

	    fits our needs and speeds up the server a lot. The memory
	    management subsystem needs to be initialized upon server
	    startup. The initialization mainly creates internal data structures
	    and allocates memory region to be partitioned.

	<para>
	    SER has built-in support for FIFO control. It means that the

    <section id="ser_configuration">
	<title>Server Configuration</title>
	<para>
	    The server is configured through a configuration file. The
	    configuration file is C-Shell like script which defines how
	    incoming requests should be processed. The file cannot be
	    interpreted directly because that would be very slow. Instead of
	    that the file is translated into an internal binary
	    representation. The process is called compilation and will be
	    described in the following sections.
	</para>
	<note>
	    <para>
		The following sections only describe how the internal binary
		representation is being constructed from the config file. The
		way how the binary representation is used upon a request
		arrival will be described later.
	    </para>
	</note>
	<para>The compilation can be divided in several steps:</para>
	
	<section id="lexical_analysis">
	    <title>Lexical Analysis</title>
	    <para>
		Lexical analysis is process of converting the input (the
		configuration file in this case) into a stream of tokens. A
		token is a set of characters that 'belong' together. A program
		that can turn the input into stream of tokens is called
		scanner. For example, when scanner encounters a number in the
		config file, it will produce token NUMBER.
	    </para>
	    <para>
		There is no need to implement the scanner from scratch, it can
		be done automatically.  There is a utility called flex. Flex
		accepts a configuration file and generates scanner according to
		the configuration file. The configuration file for flex
		consists of several lines - each line describing one token. The
		tokens are described using regular expressions. For more
		details, see flex manual page or info documentation.
	    </para>
	    <para>
		Flex input file for the SER config file is in file
		<filename>cfg.lex</filename>. The file is processed by flex
		when the server is being compiled and the result is written in
		file <filename>lex.yy.c</filename>. The output file contains
		the scanner implemented in the C language.
	    </para>
	</section> <!-- lex-analysis -->
	
	<section id="syntax_analysis">
	    <title>Syntactical Analysis</title>
	    <para>
		The second stage of configuration file processing is called
		syntactical analysis. Purpose of syntactical analysis is to
		check if the configuration file has been well formed, doesn't
		contain syntactical errors and perform various actions at
		various stages of the analysis.  Program performing syntactical
		analysis is called parser.
	    </para>
	    <para>
		Structure of the configuration file is described using
		grammar. Grammar is a set of rules describing valid 'order' or
		'combination' of tokens. If the file isn't conformable with
		it's grammar, it is syntactically invalid and cannot be further
		processed. In that case an error will be issued and the server
		will be aborted.
	    </para>
	    <para>
		There is a utility called yacc. Input of the utility is a file
		containing the grammar of the configuration file, in addition
		to the grammar, you can describe what action the parser should
		do at various stages of parsing. For example, you can instruct
		the parser to create a structure describing an IP address every
		time it finds an IP address in the configuration file and
		convert the address to its binary representation.
	    </para>
	    <para>For more information see yacc documentation.</para>
	    <para>
		yacc creates the parser when the server is being compiled from
		the sources.  Input file for yacc is
		<filename>cfg.y</filename>. The file contains grammar of the
		config file along with actions that create the binary
		representation of the file.  Yacc will write its result into
		file <filename>cfg.tab.c</filename>. The file contains function
		<function>yyparse</function> which will parse the whole
		configuration file and construct the binary representation. For
		more information about the bison input file syntax see bison
		documentation.

	<section id="config_structure">
	    <title>Config File Structure</title>
	    <para>
		The configuration file consist of three sections, each of the
		sections will be described separately.
	    </para>
	    <itemizedlist>
		<listitem>
		    <para>
			<emphasis>Route Statement</emphasis> - The statement
			describes how incoming requests will be processed.
			When a request is received, commands in one or more
			"route" sections will be executed step by step. The
			config file must always contain one main "route"
			statement and may contain several additional "route"
			statements. Request processing always starts at the
			beginning of the main "route" statement. Additional
			"route" statements can be called from the main one or
			another additional "route" statements (It it similar to
			function calling).
		    </para>
		</listitem>
		<listitem>
		    <para>
			<emphasis>Assign Statement</emphasis> - There are many
			configuration variables across the server and this
			statement makes it possible to change their
			value. Generally it is a list of assignments, each
			assignment on a separate line.
		    </para>
		</listitem>
		<listitem>
		    <para>
			<emphasis>Module Statement</emphasis> - Additional
			functionality of the server is available through
			separate modules. Each module is a shared object that
			can be loaded at runtime. Modules can export functions,
			that can be called from the configuration file and
			variables, that can be configured from the config
			file. The module statement makes it possible to load
			modules and configure them. There are two commands in
			the statement - <function>loadmodule</function> and
			<function>modparam</function>.  The first can load a
			module. The second one can configure module's internal
			variables.
		    </para>
		</listitem>
	    </itemizedlist>
	    <para>
		In the following sections we will describe in detail how the
		three sections are being processed upon server startup.
	    </para>

	    <section id="route_statement">
		<title>Route Statement</title>
		<para>The following grammar snippet describes how the route statement is constructed</para>
		<programlisting>
route_stm = "route" "{" actions "}"  
{ 
    $$ = push($3, &amp;rlist[DEFAULT_RT]); 
}

cmd = "forward" "(" host ")" { $$ = mk_action(FORWARD_T, STRING_ST, NUMBER_ST, $3, 0)
| ...
		</programlisting>
		<para>
		    A config file can contain one or more "route"
		    statements. "route" statement without number will be
		    executed first and is called the main route
		    statement. There can be additional route statements
		    identified by number, these additional route statements can
		    be called from the main route statement or another
		    additional route statements.
		</para>
		<para>
		    Each route statement consists of a set of actions. Actions
		    in the route statement are executed step by step in the
		    same order in which they appear in the config file. Actions
		    in the route statement are delimited by semicolon.
		</para>
		<para>
		    Each action consists of one and only one command (cmd in
		    the grammar). There are many types of commands defined. We
		    don't list all of them here because the list would be too
		    long and all the commands are processed in the same
		    way. Therefore we show only one example (forward) and
		    interested readers might look in <filename>cfg.y</filename>
		    file for full list of available commands.
		</para>
		<para>
		    Each rule in the grammar contains a section enclosed in
		    curly braces. The section is the C code snippet that will
		    be executed every time the parser recognizes that rule in
		    the config file.
		</para>
		<para>
		    For example, when the parser finds
		    <function>forward</function> command,
		    <function>mk_action</function> function (as specified in
		    the grammar snippet above) will be called. The function
		    creates a new structure with
		    <structfield>type</structfield> field set to FORWARD_T
		    representing the command. Pointer to the structure will be
		    returned as the return value of the rule.
		</para>
		<para>
		    The pointer propagates through <function>action</function>
		    rule to <function>actions</function>
		    rule. <function>Actions</function> rule will create linked
		    list of all commands. The linked list will be then inserted
		    into <structfield>rlist</structfield> table.  (Function
		    <function>push</function> in rule
		    <function>route_stm</function>).  Each element of the table
		    represents one "route" statement of the config file.
		</para>
		<para>
		    Each route statement of the configuration file will be
		    represented by a linked list of all actions in the
		    statement. Pointers to all the lists will be stored in
		    rlist array. Additional route statements are identified by
		    number. The number also serves as index to the array.
		</para>
		<para>
		    When the core is about to execute route statement with
		    number n, it will look in the array at position n. If the
		    element at position n is not null then there is a linked
		    list of commands and the commands will be executed step by
		    step.
		</para>
		<para>
		    Reply-Route statement is compiled in the same way. Main differences are:

	<para>
	    The rest of the initialization process depends on value of
	    <varname>dont_fork</varname> variable.
	    <varname>dont_fork</varname> is a global variable defined in
	    <filename>main.c</filename>.  We will describe both variants
	    separately.

	    <para>
		If <varname>dont_fork</varname> variable is set, the server
		will be operating in special mode.  There will be only one
		process processing incoming requests. This is very slow and was
		intended mainly for debugging purposes. The main process will
		be processing all incoming requests itself.
	    </para>
	    <para>
		The server still needs additional children:
	    </para>
	    <itemizedlist>
		<listitem>
		    <para>
			One child is for the timer subsystem, the child will be
			processing timers independently of the main process.
		    </para>
		</listitem>
		<listitem>
		    <para>
			FIFO server will spawn another child if enabled. The
			child will be processing all commands coming through
			the fifo interface.
		    </para>
		</listitem>
		<listitem>
		    <para>If SNMP support was enabled, another child will be created.</para>
		</listitem>
	    </itemizedlist>
	    
	    <para>
		The following initialization will be performed in dont fork
		mode.  (look into function <function>main_loop</function> in
		file <filename>main.c</filename>.
	    </para>

	    <itemizedlist>
		<listitem>
		    <para>Another child will be forked for the timer subsystem.</para>
		</listitem>
		<listitem>
		    <para>
			Initialize the FIFO server if enabled, this will fork
			another child.  For more info about the FIFO server,
			see section The FIFO server.
		    </para>
		</listitem>
		<listitem>
		    <para>
			Call <function>init_child(0).</function> The function
			performs per-child specific initialization of all
			loaded modules.  A module can be initialized though
			<function>mod_init</function> function.  The function
			is called <emphasis>BEFORE</emphasis> the server forks
			and thus is common for all children.
		    </para>
		    <para>
			If there is anything, that needs to be initialized in
			every child separately (for example if each child needs
			to open its own file descriptor), it cannot be done in
			<function>mod_init</function>.  To make such
			initialization possible, a module can export another
			initialization function called
			<function>init_child</function>. The function will be
			called in all children <emphasis>AFTER</emphasis> fork
			of the server.
		    </para>
		    <para>
			And since we are in "dont fork" mode and there will no
			children processing requests (remember the main process
			will be processing all requests), the
			<function>init_child</function> wouldn't be called.
		    </para>
		    <para>
			That would be bad, because
			<function>child_init</function> might do some
			initialization that must be done otherwise modules
			might not work properly.
		    </para>
		    <para>
			To make sure that module initialization is complete we
			will call <function>init_child</function> here for the
			main process even if we are not going to fork.
		    </para>
		</listitem>
	    </itemizedlist>
	    <para>
		That's it. Everything has been initialized properly and as the
		last step we will call <function>udp_rcv_loop</function> which
		is the main loop function. The function will be described
		later.
	    </para>
	</section> <!-- dont-fork-set -->

	<section id="dont_fork_not_set">
	    <title><varname>dont_fork</varname> is not set (zero)</title>
	    <para>
		<varname>dont_fork</varname> is not set. That means that the
		server will fork children and the children will be processing
		incoming requests. How many children will be created depends on
		the configuration (<varname>children</varname> variable). The
		main process will be sleeping and handling signals only.
	    </para>

	    <para>
		The main process will then initialize the FIFO server. The FIFO
		server needs another child to handle communication over FIFO
		and thus another child will be created. The FIFO server will be
		described in more detail later.
	    </para>

	    <para>
		Then the main process will perform another fork for the timer
		attendant. The child will take care of timer lists and execute
		specified function when a timer hits.
	    </para>
	    <para>
		The main process is now completely initialized, it will sleep
		in <function>pause</function> function until a signal comes and
		call <function>handle_sigs</function> when such condition
		occurs.
	    </para>
	    
	    <para>
		The following initialization will be performed by each child
		separately:
	    </para>
	    <para>
		Each child executes <function>init_child</function>
		function. The function will sequentially call
		<function>child_init</function> functions of all loaded
		modules.
	    </para>
	    <para>
		Because the function is called in each child separately, it can
		initialize per-child specific data. For example if a module
		needs to communicate with database, it must open a database
		connection. If the connection would be opened in
		<function>mod_init</function> function, all the children would
		share the same connection and locking would be necessary to
		avoid conflicts. On the other hand if the connection was opened
		in <function>child_init</function> function, each child will
		have its own connection and concurrency conflicts will be
		handled by the database server.
	    </para>
	    <para>
		And last, but not least, each child executes
		<function>udp_rcv_loop</function> function which contains the
		main loop logic.
	    </para>
