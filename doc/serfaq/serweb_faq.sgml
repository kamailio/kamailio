	    <question>
		<simpara>
		    I have serweb running. I'm able to connect to <acronym>MySQL</acronym> fine. But
		    it doesn't seem like the form params are getting assigned to variables. Is there
		    something obvious I'm missing?
		</simpara>
	    </question>
	    <answer>
		<simpara>
		    Please check if <varname>register_globals</varname> is set to On in your
		    <filename>php.ini</filename> file. The option is set off by default due to
		    security reasons.

	    <question>
		<simpara>
		    Can somebody tell me how to configure the serweb? Which directory should I put
		    those files and which file and parameters should I modify. Or maybe this
		    question was asked previously by somebody already, then please provide me a like
		    to those answers.

	    <answer>

		<simpara>
		    What version of ser should I use with serweb from the CVS ?
		</simpara>
	    </question>
	    <answer>
		<simpara>
