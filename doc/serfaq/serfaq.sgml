		<question>
		    <simpara>
			Is it possible to use &ser; as a &sip; user agent (both of User Agent Client
			(&uac;) and User Agent Server (&uas;)?
		    </simpara>
		</question>
		<answer>
		    <simpara>
			Not easily. &ser; has built-in some functions that allow to use it as user
			agent, but our primary goal is to develop a server so this is without
			guarantee and can even disappear in future versions.
		    </simpara>
		</answer>
	    </qandaentry>
	    <qandaentry>
		<question>
		    <simpara>
			Can &ser; work well together with some of the location server (e. g.LDAP or DNS) ?
		    </simpara>
		</question>
		<answer>
		    <simpara>
			&ser;'s built-in location server uses in-<acronym>RAM</acronym> database for
			high performance and optionally MySQL for persistence. More database
			protocols may be supplied on contractual basis. As far as I know,
			<acronym>DNS</acronym> is not used in the industry for user location.

		<question>
		    <simpara>
			What is a proxy server ?
		    </simpara>
		</question>
		<answer>
		    <simpara>
			A proxy server is an entity that routes &sip; messages. See &sip
			introduction which is part of the distribution.
		    </simpara>
		</answer>
	    </qandaentry>
	    <qandaentry>
		<question>
		    What is the difference between proxy server and back to back user agent (B2BUA) ?
		</question>
		<answer>
		    <simpara>
			The main difference is that proxy servers are transaction-stateful, while
			B2BUAs are call stateful. That means proxy servers keep state only during
			&sip; transactions (that is at the beginning and and of a call) and do not
			keep any state during the whole call.
		    </simpara>
		    <simpara>
			A B2BUA acts merely as connection of two or more user agents which are
			connected through some means. B2BUAs keep some state (usually some structures
			in the memory) during the whole call.
		    </simpara>
		    <para>
			This property gives B2BUA some interesting features that proxies don't
			have. For example B2BUA can tear down and existing call--proxies can't do
			that. On the other hand B2BUAs can easily become a bottleneck in terms of
			scalability.
		    </para>
		</answer>
	    </qandaentry>
	    <qandaentry>
		<question>
		    <simpara>
			So is &ser; proxy or B2BUA ? Can it terminate an existing call ?
		    </simpara>
		</question>
		<answer>
		    <simpara>
			&ser; is a proxy. I can't terminate existing call.

		<question>
		    <simpara>
			I'd like to know if &ser; supports <acronym>CPL</acronym> and
			servlets. Where can I find any documentation about this, or any link ?
		    </simpara>
		    </question>
		    <answer>
		    <simpara>
			Yes, <acronym>CPL</acronym> is supported through cpl module, the module
			needs an external <acronym>CPL</acronym> interpreter written in Java. A C
			version is under development. There is no support for Java servlets. The
			documentation can be found at <ulink

		<answer>
		    <simpara>
			Last time we have  checked ~4900cps on a dual Athlon MP2000.
		    </simpara>
		    <simpara>
			This was ser 0.8.9 running statefully (stateless is should be much faster),

			Do you have any thoughts on how it compares in deployability and features to

			thinking of that would make a commercial venture with &ser; difficult
			(licensing, scaling, etc..)
		    </simpara>
		</question>
		<answer>
		    <simpara>
			&ser; is licensed under &gnu; &gpl;. I would be surprised if any &sip;
			server available today would scale a bit better--we spent lot of work on
			performance, achieved thousands of <acronym>CPS</acronym> on a
			<acronym>PC</acronym>--I guess it will take lot of time until your demand
			hits this capacity.

			Is it necessary to have a <acronym>DNS SVR</acronym> Resource Record, as

		    </simpara>
		</question>
		<answer>
		    <simpara>
			No. It's nice to have it, but you can work around it setting a normal A
			record for your domain. The <acronym>SRV</acronym> lookup will fall back to
			normal A lookup.

			We have a question regarding usrloc: where are the active sessions

		    </simpara>
		</question>
		<answer>
		    <simpara>
			&ser; has no notion of active session. &ser; is a transaction-stateful proxy,
			that means it knows about transactions (INVITE transaction, BYE
			transaction), but it keeps no state if there is no transaction active.
		    </simpara>
		    <simpara>
			That means, it keeps state when an INVITE comes and until a final response
			to the INVITE is sent. The same for BYE.

			?
		    </simpara>
		</question>
		<answer>
		    <simpara>
			Aliases are tied to user location. It uses a special table which has the
			same structure as user location table and includes an entry for each
			alias. You do not have to do something special for that. You have to create
			this table and then you can use serctl to add aliases.

			That's a theoretical &sip; option today, &ser; is not supporting
			session-timer.  We gave it a try more than one year ago and gave up due to
			interop problems.  The specification was developing at that time so quickly
			that there was not any UA which would work with another one correctly.
		    </simpara>
		    <simpara>
			Once the interoperability gets better, it could be worth implementing. It is
			in general a nice mechanism for avoiding session state silo in network,
			which is good for scalability.

			how can i configure my ser for multiple domains?

		    </simpara>
		</question>
		<answer>
		    <simpara>
			If you are using 0.8.10, it is a manual process--copy and paste
			<acronym>SQL</acronym> tables, have a table set for each served domain, and
			refer to the table names from your scripts. E.g.,
		    </simpara>
		    <simpara>
			if (uri=~"domain1.com") { lookup("domain1"); ...
		    </simpara>
		    <simpara>
			With 0.8.11 you can automate the process quite a lot. Authorization
			functions with realm set to empty value take domain name from &sip;
			requests. User location database keeps track of domains as well. The
			<quote>domain</quote> modules allows you to keep track of maintained domains
			in a way which does not take changing scripts.
		    </simpara>
		    <simpara>
			It is possible there are some magic options in domain/usrloc/auth_db/
			registrar/auth modules you need to turn on to enable multidomain
			operation--I don't remember these by heart, hopefuly some people
			on the mailing list do.
