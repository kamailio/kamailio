Kamailio git commit rules
=========================

1. Changing other people's code:
--------------------------------
 - send a patch to the code/module mantainer and/or sr-dev 
   (don't commit changes to code you don't own if you don't have the mantainer's approval)
Exceptions:
 a. compilation (this includes warning) fixes
 b. bug fixes
 c. API changes (some external functions definitions change)
 d. small changes due to a new release in the very near future (allowed only for the release manager)

2. Code requirements
--------------------
2.1 Unstable branch:
 - the code must compile (at least on one architecture). If the code does not compile, 
   but you still want to commit it, comment it out (#if 0 ... #endif)
 - the code should compile without warnings (with -Wall) (exceptions: very difficult to avoid warnings)
 - follow Kamailio coding style

2.2. Stable branch (everything for unstable branch +)
------------------------------------------------------
 - the code should compile on all the architectures (this currently includes
   linux, freebsd, netbsd, openbsd, solaris >= 8; x86, ultrasparc, strongarm;
   gcc 4.x, icc, sun cc >=5.3). It should also compile on gcc 2.95 and 3.x.
 - the code must be tested or the change trivial enough
 - the code should compile without warnings on all the arhitectures (with some exceptions)
