	    <para>
		SER is an open-source project that aims to make available a
		fully functional and scalable Session Initiated Protocol
		server. Call processing is described with a concise scripting
		language that offers the flexibility of regular expressions and
		the ability to interface with 3rd party applications for the
		purposes of call accounting and authorization.

		Installing SER on a RedHat Linux distribution for example, is a
		simple matter of unzipping the downloaded file and using your
		favorite package manager.
	    </para>
	</section>

	<section id="install_package">
	    <title>Install the package</title>
	    <para>
		Example:
	    </para>
	    <screen>
/root&gt;rpm -i ser-08.11-1.i386.rpm
	    </screen>
	    <para>
		Packages for other popular distributions are available, and can be installed using
		the appropriate package manager for that distribution.
	    </para>
	    <para>
		On many platforms you can start the service with:
	    </para>
	    <screen>
/etc/init.d/ser start
	    </screen>
	    <para>
		RedHat systems will use:
	    </para>
	    <screen>
/etc/rc.d/init.d/ser start
	    </screen>
	    <para>
		You now have a functioning SIP server, but what can you do with it?  At this point
		not very much. With an SIP client, such as Microsoft MSN Messenger 4.6, you can
		register with the server, send Instant Messages to other logged on clients of the
		same server, and even have voice conversations with them.
	    </para>
	    <para>
		That sounds pretty good, but maybe you'd like to add a little more security, or make
		you server accessible to others.
	    </para>
	</section>

	<section id="serctl_utility">
	    <title>Serctl Utility</title>
	    <para>
		To do so, first set the environment variable SIP_DOMAIN to your domain name, e.g.,
		in Bourne shell (bash), call:
	    </para>
	    <screen>
export SIP_DOMAIN="foo.bar"
	    </screen>
	    <para>
		If you wont the system to created this variable automatically, you need to add the
		line
	    </para>
	    <screen>
export SIP_DOMAIN="foo.bar"
	    </screen>
	    <para>
		in the end of file /etc/profile.
	    </para>
	    <para>
		If you are using other than 'localhost' mysql server for maintaining subscriber
		database, change the variable 'SQL_HOST' to the proper host name in the serctl
		script.
	    </para>
	    <para>
		Run the serctl utility
	    </para>
	    <screen>
/usr/sbin/serctl monitor
	    </screen>
	    <para>
		If you installed from a tar.gz or Solaris package:

	<section id="dns_srv">
	    <title>DNS SVR Resource Records</title>
	    <para>
		It is important that your SIP clients can connect to your
		server for purposes of registration and call control.  You
		might even want to have a redundant server to handle calls if
		your primary server is unavailable.
	    </para>
	    <para>
		These requirements can be meet by using <acronym>DNS</acronym>
		<acronym>SVR</acronym> Resource Records, available in BIND 8.X and up releases.
	    </para>
	    <para>
		The format for a <acronym>SVR RR</acronym> is this:
	    </para>
	    <screen>
_service._protocol        SVR Priority Weight     Port hostname
	    </screen>
	    <para>
		In this case we want to establish an entry for our primary SIP server,
		gateway.mydomain.com, that will listen on UDP port 5060.  The entry will look like
		this:
	    </para>
	    <screen>
_sip._udp         SRV     0  0   5060  gateway.mydomain.com
	    </screen>
	    <para>
		Placement of the new resource record is important.  Here is a sample zone file:
		</para>
		<para>
		<screen>
; zone 'mydomain.com'   last serial 1998071308
$ORIGIN com.
mydomain  86400           IN      SOA     gateway.mydomain.com. postmaster.mydomain.com. (
                                        1998111908 ; Serial
                                        36000 ; Refresh
                                        900 ; Retry
                                        36000 ; Expire
                                        28800 ); Minimum
                IN      NS              gateway.mydomain.com.
                IN      NS              ns3.backupdomain.com.
                IN      MX              1 gateway.mydomain.com.
                IN      A               192.168.0.1

;If we place the SRV record above the next line it fails to load
$ORIGIN fitawi.com.
_sip._udp               SRV  0 0  5060  gateway.mydomain.com.
gateway         IN      A               192.168.0.1

		</screen>
	    </para>
	    <para>
		After reloading your zone file you can verify that the entry is working by using dig.
	    </para>
	    <screen>
dig -t SRV _sip._udp.mydomain.com
	    </screen>
	    <para>
		The results should look something like this:

		To install support for a MySQL database you will need to download the package
		ser-mysql, which is available from the same download location that you retrieved
		SER. This package has scripts to create the required database and establish
		permissions for the accounts needed.  A recent release of MySQL is recommended.
		Earlier versions may have problems with the syntax required to set permissions on
		the database.
	    </para>

		If you do not already have a copy of MySQL installed, download it from your <ulink

	    </para>
	    <screen>

	    <title>Modify SER configuration</title>
	    <para>
		Now that we have a working MySQL database, we need to modify the configuration file
		for ser, located on a RedHat, installed in /etc/ser/ser.cfg.  The following changes
		need to be made:
	    </para>
	    <para>
		To enable support for the new MySQL database we need to load the appropriate module.
		That is accomplished by uncomment this line:
	    </para>
	    <screen>
loadmodule "/usr/lib/ser/modules/mysql.so
	    </screen>
	    <para>
		Next we need to set SER to use the database and write changes instead of just
		caching them in memory. This is done by means of commenting this line:
	    </para>
	    <screen>
modparam ("usrloc", "db_mode",  0)
	    </screen>
	    <para>
		And uncomment this line:
	    </para>
	    <screen>
modparam ("usrloc", "db_mode", 2)
	    </screen>
	    <para>
		Note on db_modes:

		<itemizedlist>
		    <listitem>
			<para>

			</para>
		    </listitem>
		    <listitem>
			<para>
			    Mode 1
			</para>
			<para>
			    Writes all changes to the database immediately. Contact information is
			    saved to the database immediately.  This can slow the response to
			    clients as they connect.
			</para>
		    </listitem>
		    <listitem>
			<para>
			    Mode 2
			</para>
			<para>
			    Periodically writes contact information to the database based in the in
			    memory cache.
			</para>
		    </listitem>
		</itemizedlist>
	    </para>
	    <para>
		To enable digest authentication we additionally need to uncomment the following two lines:
	    </para>
	    <screen>
loadmodule "/usr/lib/ser/modules/auth.so"
loadmodule "/usr/lib/ser/modules/auth_db.so"
	    </screen>
	    <para>
		We have the option of storing passwords in our database in plain text.  This allows
		for password recovery and makes the initial setup and testing easier.  To enable
		this feature uncomment these lines:
	    </para>
	    <screen>
modparam ("auth_db", "calculate_ha1", yes)
modparam ("auth_db", "password_column", "password")
	    </screen>
	    <para>
		These lines work together. The first tells SER to generate a hash based on
		username, password and realm. The second tells SER where to look for the plain-text
		password in the database.
	    </para>
	    <para>
		Uncomment these lines and change all instances of iptel.org to your domain
	    </para>
	    <para>
		<screen>
if (!www_authorize("mydomain.com", "subscriber")) {
        www_challenge("mydomain.com", "0");
        break;
};

	    </para>
	    <para>
		We're now ready to restart ser. On RedHat use
	    </para>
	    <screen>
/etc/rc.d/init.d/ser restart
	    </screen>
	</section>

	<section>
	    <title>Adding an admin for your realm</title>
	    <para>
		Now that we have a working database and ser is configured to use it, we need to add
		some users and at least one of them should have administrator privileges.  The
		administrator role becomes important if you want to use a web management tool such
		as serweb.
	    </para>
	    <para>
		Basic account manipulation can be performed with the serctl script, located in
		/usr/sbin.
	    </para>
	    <para>
		To add a user use these commands
	    </para>
	    <screen>
		serctl add JoeUser qwerty joe@mydomain.com
	    </screen>
	    <para>
		The system notify for "Type MySQL Password", the default password is
		"heslo"
	    </para>
	    <para>
		To make JoeUser an administrator, we need to login to MySQL and modify the database.

	<title>Issues And Limitation</title>

	<para>
	    Since one of the design goals behind SIP is to decentralize the intelligence in
	    communications handling, a basic tenant is that SIP clients need to be able to
	    communicate directly with each other. The problem is that many clients find themselves
	    either behind a firewall or in a NAT fronted address space. When a client registers
	    with the SIP server, it tells the server what it is using for an IP address, and that
	    address may not be accessible to the public.
	</para>
	<section>
	    <title>More on NAT</title>
	    <para>
		There are a couple of ways that we can overcome the problem that NAT introduces.
		Some SIP client providers are building in options into their products that allow the
		user to identify the IP address that their phone will appear as to the public.  This
		is a nice simple approach, but presumes that the person installing the client knows
		what that IP address is, and that it doesn't change.  Cisco has built this feature
		into their 79XX series SIP phones.
	    </para>
	    <para>
		A second solution that is working its way through the standards process is called
		<quote>Simple Traversal of UDP through NAT</quote>, or <acronym>STUN</acronym>.
		A <acronym>STUN</acronym> equipped client is configured to send a who-am-I packet to
		a known server on the public network.  That server will respond with the IP
		address that the client appears to be communicating from, and the client can then
		use that address to register with the SIP server.  Phones that leverage
		<acronym>STUN</acronym> include: Snom 100, kphone, and sipc .
	    </para>
	</section>
	<section>
	    <title>Firewalls</title>
	    <para>
		SIP clients also present an interesting challenge to configuring a firewall.  During
		registration the SIP client will be assigned a UDP port in the range of 16384 to
		32768.  Our firewall administrators will not happily open up all of those ports to
		all of the internal systems, on the chance that a SIP connection may be needed.
	    </para>
	    <para>
		This is where the concept of a Firewall Control Protocol, or <acronym>FCP</acronym>,
		comes into play.  The design idea is that when a SIP client registers, a
		<acronym>FCP</acronym> agent, or server if you prefer, will dynamically insert a new
		rule into the firewall policy to permit that client to participate in SIP
		conversations.

	<title>Diagnostics And Tools</title>
	<para>
	    Detailed information about the communications between clients and the SIP server is
	    needed to isolate problems.  Two tools that can be used to gather such information are
	    sipsak and ngrep.
	</para>
	<section>
	    <title>ngrep</title>
	    <para>
		Ngrep is a capable of listening in on network traffic and filtering it in much the
		same way as grep can locate patterns in files.  To monitor the communications
		between a client, joe, and the server the following command would be run on the
		server:
	    </para>
	    <screen>
ngrep  -n 5060 -d eth0 joe
	    </screen>
	    <para>
		Since SIP communications are <acronym>ASCII</acronym> based, all events such as
		REGISTER, INVITE, SUBSCRIBE, etc. are captured.  The output of ngrep can identify
		problems with SIP addresses, or client identity.
	    </para>

		Ngrep should be part of most modern distributions, or can be downloaded from <ulink
