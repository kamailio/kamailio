    <!-- If xsltproc gets here while searching the catalog then no entry was
         found in the catalog files for the requested resource and in this
         case xsltproc will attempt to download the resource from the internet
         using the HTTP protocol. It will use the HTTP URIs from system
         identifiers and URI references (therefore the XSL customization
         stylesheets in SR refer to the original XSL stylesheets using HTTP
         URIs). Note: Downloading DTDs and XSL stylesheets can be very slow,
         because each file will be downloaded several times, xsltproc does not
         cache downloaded files.
