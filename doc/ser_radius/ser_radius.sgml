	<title>Introduction</title>
	<simpara>
	    &ser can be configured to use &rad; server for authentication, accounting, and group
	    membership checking. Since configuration of &rad; seems to be a common source of
	    problems, we decided to put together this howto.
	</simpara>
	<simpara>
	    The howto covers installation and configuration of FreeRADIUS server only. There are
	    also other &rad; servers available and as long as they support digest authentication,
	    they should work too. Any volunteers willing to describe setup of other &rad; servers
	    are encouraged to contact the author.
	</simpara>
	<section>
	    <title>Prerequisities</title>
	    <simpara>
		To setup &rad; support in &ser; you will need the following:
	    </simpara>
	    <itemizedlist>
		<listitem>
		    <simpara>
			FreeRADIUS server, you can get it from <ulink
			    url="http://www.freeradius.org">FreeRADIUS website</ulink>. The howto
			    describes installation and setup of release 0.9.1.
		    </simpara>
		</listitem>
		<listitem>
		    <simpara>
			Radiusclient library, you can get it from <ulink
			    url="http://www.mcs.de/~lf/radius">http://www.mcs.de/~lf/radius</ulink>.
			    The howto describes installation and setup of version 0.3.2.
		    </simpara>
		</listitem>
		<listitem>
		    <simpara>
			&ser;, get it from <ulink url="http://iptel.org/ser">http://iptel.org/ser</ulink>
		    </simpara>
		</listitem>
		<listitem>
		    <simpara>
			You should also have some experience in configuring &ser;. Before you enable
			&rad; authentication or accounting make sure that the basic server is
			running and that you know how to customize it to your taste.
		    </simpara>
		</listitem>
		<listitem>
		    <simpara>
			If you want to use &rad; accounting then you will have to compile &ser; from
			sources so you should know how to do it.
		    </simpara>
		</listitem>
	    </itemizedlist>
	    <simpara>
		Various unix/linux distributions might include binary packages of the mentioned
		applications. In that case you can safely use the packages, there shouldn't be any
		problem. Location of some files may be different, though. We will describe
		how to install the software from sources only.
	    </simpara>
	    <warning>
		<simpara>
		    Configuration of FreeRADIUS server described in the document is in no way
		    exhaustive. This document is a sort of quick-start-guide, it shows how to get
		    things running, but you should definitely read FreeRADIUS documentation
		    and configure the server properly ! You have been warned.

	<title>Radiusclient Library</title>
	<simpara>
	    Untar the source tarball.
	</simpara>
	<screen format="linespecific">
root@localhost:/usr/local/src# tar xvfz radiusclient-0.3.2.tar.gz
</screen>
	    <simpara>
		Compile and install the library.
	    </simpara>
	    <screen format="linespecific">
root@localhost:/usr/local/src# cd radiusclient-0.3.2
root@localhost:/usr/local/src/radiusclient-0.3.2# ./configure
root@localhost:/usr/local/src/radiusclient-0.3.2# make
root@localhost:/usr/local/src/radiusclient-0.3.2# make install
</screen>
	<simpara>
	    By default all the configuration files of the radiusclient library will be in
	    <filename moreinfo="none">/usr/local/etc/radiusclient</filename> directory.
	</simpara>
	<simpara>
	    If you use binary packages then the configuration files will be probably in <filename
	    moreinfo="none">/etc/radiusclient</filename>.
	</simpara>
	<section>
	    <title>File <filename moreinfo="none">radiusclient.conf</filename></title>
	    <simpara>
		The main configuration file of the library is <filename
		    moreinfo="none">/usr/local/etc/radiusclient/radiusclient.conf</filename>, open
		    the file in your favourite text editor and find lines containing the following:
	    </simpara>
	    <programlisting format="linespecific">
authserver      localhost
</programlisting>
	    <simpara>
		This is the hostname or &ip; address of the RADIUS server used for authentication. You
		will have to change this unless the server is running on the same host as your &sip;
		proxy.
	    </simpara>
	    <programlisting format="linespecific">
acctserver      localhost
</programlisting>
	    <simpara>
		This is the hostname or &ip; address of the RADIUS server used for accounting. You
		will have to change this unless the server is running on the same host as your &sip
		proxy.
	    </simpara>
	</section>
	<section>
	    <title>File <filename moreinfo="none">servers</filename></title>
	    <simpara>
		&rad; protocol uses simple access control mechanism based on shared secrets
		that allows &rad; servers to limit access from &rad; clients. A &rad; server is
		configured with a secret string and only &rad; clients that have the same
		secret will be accepted.
	    </simpara>
	    <simpara>
		You need to configure a shared secret for each server you have configured in
		    <filename moreinfo="none">radiusclient.conf</filename> file in the previous
		    step. The shared secrets are stored in <filename
		    moreinfo="none">/usr/local/etc/radiusclient/servers</filename> file.
	    </simpara>
	    <simpara>
		Each line contains hostname of a &rad; server and shared secret used in
		communication with that server. The two values are separated by
		whitespaces. Configure shared secrets for every &rad; server you are going to use.
	    </simpara>
	    <warning>
		<simpara>
		    &rad; servers and clients must be configured with the same shared secret,
		    otherwise they will not accept RADIUS messages from each other and neither
		    authentication nor accounting will work !
		</simpara>
	    </warning>
	</section>
	<section>
	    <title>File <filename moreinfo="none">dictionary</filename></title>
	    <simpara>
		&ser; uses some attributes that are not included in the dictionary of radiusclient
		library, therefore it is necesarry to add them. Unfortunatelly the dictionary file
		used by &ser is not included in the source tarball of &ser;, so far it is in
		unstable branch of the <ulink url="http://iptel.org/ser/cvs">CVS</ulink> only, but
		it will be included in one of future releases. Meanwhile you can get it from the <ulink
		url="http://cvs.berlios.de/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/ser/sip_router/etc/dictionary.ser?rev=HEAD">CVS web interface</ulink>.
	    </simpara>
	    <simpara>
		Download the file and put it into <filename
		moreinfo="none">/usr/local/etc/radiusclient</filename> directory and then append it
		to the main dictionary file:
	    </simpara>
	    <screen format="linespecific">
root@localhost:/usr/local/etc/radiusclient# cat dictionary.ser &gt;&gt; dictionary
</screen>
	    <simpara>
		That will append contents of <filename moreinfo="none">dictionary.ser</filename>
		file to <filename moreinfo="none">dictionary</filename> file which contains the
		main dictionary for the radiusclient library.
	    </simpara>

    <chapter>
	<title>FreeRADIUS Server</title>
	<simpara>
	    Untar, configure, build, and install the server:
	</simpara>
	    <screen format="linespecific">
root@localhost:/usr/local/src# tar xvfz freeradius-0.9.1.tar.gz
root@localhost:/usr/local/src# cd freeradius-0.9.1
root@localhost"/usr/local/src/freeradius-0.9.1# ./configure
root@localhost"/usr/local/src/freeradius-0.9.1# make
root@localhost"/usr/local/src/freeradius-0.9.1# make install
</screen>
	<simpara>
	    All the configuration files of FreeRADIUS server will be in <filename
	    moreinfo="none">/usr/local/etc/raddb</filename> directory. If you install a binary
	    package then you will probably find them in <filename moreinfo="none">/etc/raddb</filename>.
	</simpara>
	<simpara>
	    The following sections describe how to configure freeradius server. First we describe
	    the common configuration that must be done in any case. Configuration specific for
	    authentication, accounting, and group membership checking will be described in separate
	    sections.
	</simpara>
	
	<section>
	    <title>Common configuration</title>
	    <section>
		<title>File <filename moreinfo="none">clients.conf</filename></title>
		<simpara>
		    File <filename moreinfo="none">/usr/local/etc/raddb/clients.conf</filename>
		    contains description of &rad; clients that are allowed to use the server. For
		    each of the clients you need to specify it's hostname or &ip address and also a
		    shared secret. The shared secret must be the same string you configured in
		    radiusclient library.
		</simpara>
		<simpara>
		    Suppose that your &sip; server is running on host proxy.foo.bar and
		    radiusclient library on that machine has been configure with
		    <quote>foobarsecret</quote> as the shared secret. You need to put the
		    following section into the file:
		</simpara>
		<programlisting format="linespecific">
client proxy.foo.bar {
    secret = foobarsecret
    shortname = foo
}
</programlisting>
		<simpara>
		    This fragment allows access from &rad; clients on proxy.foo.bar if they use
		    <quote>foobarsecret</quote> as the shared secret.
		</simpara>
		<note>
		    <simpara>
			The file already contains an entry for localhost (127.0.0.1), so if you are
			running the &rad; server on the same host as your &sip; server, then modify
			the existing entry instead. By default it contains shared secret
			<quote>testing123</quote>.
		    </simpara>
		</note>
	    </section>
	    
	    <section>
		<title>File <filename moreinfo="none">dictionary</filename></title>
		<simpara>
		    File <filename moreinfo="none">/usr/local/etc/raddb/dictionary</filename>
		    contains the dictionary of FreeRADIUS server. You have to add the same
		    dictionary file (<filename moreinfo="none">dictionary.ser</filename>), which you
		    added to the dictionary of radiusclient library, also here. In this case you
		    don't have to append the contents of the file, you can include it into the main
		    file.  Add the following line at the end of <filename
		    moreinfo="none">/usr/local/etc/raddb/dictionary</filename>:
		</simpara>
		<programlisting format="linespecific">
$INCLUDE ../radiusclient/dictionary.ser
</programlisting>
		<simpara>
		    That will include the same attribute definitions that are used in radiusclient
		    library so the client and server will understand each other.
		</simpara>
	    </section>

	    <section>
		<title>File <filename moreinfo="none">radiusd.conf</filename></title>
		<simpara>
		    Digest authentication is disabled by default and you must enable it in this
		    file. There are two sections, <quote>authorize</quote> and
		    <quote>authenticate</quote>. Both sections contain line containing word
		    <quote>digest</quote>. Both of them are commented and you must un-comment them
		    to enable digest authentication.
		</simpara>
		<note>
		    <simpara>
			There is also another line containing word <quote>digest</quote> followed by
			curly braces and it is enabled by default. The section is supposed to
			contain digest module parameters but because digest module has no parameters,
			it is empty. This is not the line you are supposed to uncomment ! There are
			two more.
		    </simpara>
		</note>
	    </section>
	    
	    <section>
		<title>File <filename moreinfo="none">users</filename></title>
		<simpara>
		    This file contains authentication information for each user. For testing
		    purposes we will create user <quote>test</quote>. Put the following into the file:
		</simpara>
		    <programlisting format="linespecific">
test Auth-Type := Digest, User-Password == "test"
     Reply-Message = "Hello, test with digest"
</programlisting>

		<simpara>
		    The username and password is for testing only, you can safely remove the entry
		    once your RADIUS server works and you are able to authenticate.
		</simpara>

	<section>
	    <title>Test The Server</title>
	    <note>
		<simpara>
		    This step is optional.
		</simpara>
	    </note>
	    <simpara>
		The basic configuration of FreeRADIUS server is done it now we are going to test if
		it really works. Start the server with parameter -X. That will cause the server to
		stay in the foreground (it will not turn into daemon) and produce a lot of debuging
		information on the standard output:
	    </simpara>
	    <screen format="linespecific">
root@/usr/local/src# radiusd -X
</screen>
	    <simpara>
		Create file <filename moreinfo="none">digest</filename> and put the following
		into the file:
	    </simpara>
		<programlisting format="linespecific">
User-Name = "test", Digest-Response = "631d6d73147add2f9e437f59bbc3aeb7", 
Digest-Realm = "testrealm", Digest-Nonce = "1234abcd" , 
Digest-Method = "INVITE", Digest-URI = "sip:5555551212@example.com", 
Digest-Algorithm = "MD5", Digest-User-Name = "test"
</programlisting>
	    <simpara>
		All the attributes must be on a single line.
	    </simpara>
	    <simpara>
		Run <command moreinfo="none">radclient</command> to test the server:
	    </simpara>
	    <screen format="linespecific">
root@/usr/local/src# radclient -f digest localhost auth &lt;shared_secret&gt;
</screen>
	    <note>
		<simpara>
		    I suppose that you run the test utility directly on the &rad; server since
		    it comes with the FreeRADIUS server package. That also means that you have
		    to enable access from localhost in your <filename
		    moreinfo="none">clients.conf</filename> file. Don't forget to
		    replace &lt;shared_secret&gt; with the shared secret configured for locahost
		    clients in <filename moreinfo="none">clients.conf</filename>.
		</simpara>
	    </note>
	    <simpara>
		If your server works properly then you should see the following response:
	    </simpara>
	    <screen format="linespecific">
Received response ID 224, code 2, length = 45
        Reply-Message = "Hello, test with digest"
</screen>
	</section>
	
	<section>
	    <title>Authentication Configuration</title>
	    <simpara>
		To create user <quote>joe</quote> in domain <quote>iptel.org</quote> with password
		<quote>heslo</quote> put the following into file <filename
		moreinfo="none">/usr/local/etc/raddb/users</filename>:
	    </simpara>
	    <programlisting format="linespecific">
joe@iptel.org Auth-Type := Digest, User-Password == "heslo"
     Reply-Message = "Authenticated",
     Sip-Rpid = "1234"
</programlisting>
	    <simpara>
		Attribute <quote>Sip-Rpid</quote> is optional. The attribute contains a phone number
		associated to the user. &ser; can be configured to put the phone number into
		Remote-Party-ID header field of the &sip; message. The header field can be then used
		by &pstn; gateways to display the number as the number of the caller on regular
		phones. You can omit the attribute if you don't need it.
	    </simpara>
	</section>
	
	<section>
	    <title>Accounting Configuration</title>
	    <simpara>
		By default FreeRADIUS server will log all accounting requests into <filename
		    moreinfo="none">/usr/local/var/log/radius/radacct</filename> directory in form
		    of plain text files. The server will create one file for each hostname in the
		    directory. The following example shows how the log files look like.

	<title>&ser; Configuration</title>
	<simpara>
	    We will describe installation from sources here. If you use binary packages then there
	    is an additional package containg &rad; related modules. You will need to install the
	    package.
	</simpara>
	<warning>
	    <simpara>
		Due to a mistake the binary packages for &rad; do not include &rad;-enabled
		version of acc (accounting) module. The packages contain modules for &rad;
		authentication and group membership checking only.
	    </simpara>
	    <simpara>
		If you need accounting over &rad; then you will have to compile &rad;-enabled
		version of acc module from the sources. This will be fixed in one of future
		releases, we apologize for any incovenience.
	    </simpara>
	</warning>
	<simpara>
	    &rad;-related modules are not compiled by default. To compile them, edit <filename
		moreinfo="none">Makefile</filename>, find variable
	    <varname>exclude_modules</varname> and you should see <quote>auth_radius</quote>,
	    <quote>group_radius</quote>, and <quote>uri_radius</quote> among excluded
	    modules. Simply remove the three modules from the list.
	</simpara>
	<simpara>
	    If you need &rad; accounting then edit also sip_router/modules/acc/Makefile and
	    uncomment lines containing:
	</simpara>
	    <programlisting format="linespecific">
DEFS+=-DRAD_ACC
LIBS=-L$(LOCALBASE)/lib -lradiusclient

	    <title>Accounting Configuration</title>
	    <simpara>
		To enable &rad; accounting simply use <varname>radius_log_flag</varname> and
		<varname>radius_log_missed_flag</varname> parameters instead of <varname>log_flag</varname>
		and <varname>log_missed_flag</varname>. Mark transactions that should be logged with
