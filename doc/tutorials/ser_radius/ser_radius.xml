    <title>SIP-router RADIUS Howto</title>

    <section id="radius_intro">
	<title>Introduction</title>
	<simpara>
	    SIP-router can be configured to use RADIUS server for authentication,
	    accounting, and group membership checking. Since configuration of
	    RADIUS seems to be a common source of problems, we decided to put
	    together this HOWTO.
	</simpara>
	<simpara>
	    The HOWTO covers installation and configuration of FreeRADIUS
	    server only. There are other RADIUS servers available and as
	    long as they support digest authentication, they should work
	    too. Any volunteers willing to describe setup of other RADIUS
	    servers are encouraged to contact the author.
	</simpara>
	
	<section id="prerequisities">
	    <title>Prerequisites</title>
	    <simpara>
		To setup RADIUS support in SIP-router you will need the following:
	    </simpara>
	    <itemizedlist>
		<listitem>
		    <simpara>
			FreeRADIUS server, you can get it from <ulink
			    url="http://www.freeradius.org">FreeRADIUS
			    website</ulink>. The HOWTO describes installation
			and setup of release 0.9.1.
		    </simpara>
		</listitem>
		<listitem>
		    <simpara>
			Radiusclient library. In version 0.8.14 we started to
			use the new version of radiusclient library developed
			by Maxim Sobolev called radiusclient-ng. The homepage
			of the library is <ulink
			url="http://developer.berlios.de/projects/radiusclient-ng/">http://developer.berlios.de/projects/radiusclient-ng/</ulink>
		    </simpara>
		</listitem>
		<listitem>
		    <simpara>
			SIP-router, get it from <ulink url="&serhome;">&serhome;</ulink>
		    </simpara>
		</listitem>
		<listitem>
		    <simpara>
			You should also have some experience in configuring
			SIP-router. Before you enable RADIUS authentication or
			accounting make sure that the basic server is running
			and that you know how to customize it to your taste.
		    </simpara>
		</listitem>
		<listitem>
		    <simpara>
			If you want to use RADIUS accounting then you will have
			to compile SIP-router from sources so you should know how to
			do it.
		    </simpara>
		</listitem>
	    </itemizedlist>
	    <simpara>
		Various Unix/Linux distributions might include binary packages
		of the mentioned applications. In that case you can safely use
		the packages, there shouldn't be any problem. Location of some
		files may be different, though. We will describe how to install
		the software from sources only.
	    </simpara>
	    <warning>
		<simpara>
		    Configuration of FreeRADIUS server described in the
		    document is in no way exhaustive. This document is a sort
		    of quick-start-guide, it shows how to get things running,
		    but you should definitely read FreeRADIUS documentation and
		    configure the server properly ! You have been warned.

	    </simpara>
	    <programlisting>
authserver      localhost
	    </programlisting>
	    <simpara>
		This is the hostname or IP address of the RADIUS server used

		RADIUS protocol uses simple access control mechanism based on
		shared secrets that allows RADIUS servers to limit access from
		RADIUS clients. A RADIUS server is configured with a secret
		string and only RADIUS clients that have the same secret will
		be accepted.
	    </simpara>
	    <simpara>
		You need to configure a shared secret for each server you have
		configured in <filename>radiusclient.conf</filename> file in
		the previous step. The shared secrets are stored in
		<filename>/usr/local/etc/radiusclient/servers</filename> file.
	    </simpara>
	    <simpara>
		Each line contains hostname of a RADIUS server and shared
		secret used in communication with that server. The two values
		are separated by whitespaces. Configure shared secrets for
		every RADIUS server you are going to use.
	    </simpara>
	    <warning>
		<simpara>
		    RADIUS servers and clients must be configured with the same
		    shared secret, otherwise they will not accept RADIUS
		    messages from each other and neither authentication nor
		    accounting will work !

	    The following sections describe how to configure freeradius

		<title>File <filename>clients.conf</filename></title>
		<simpara>
		    File <filename>/usr/local/etc/raddb/clients.conf</filename>
		    contains description of RADIUS clients that are allowed to
		    use the server. For each of the clients you need to specify
		    its hostname or IP address and also a shared secret. The
		    shared secret must be the same string you configured in
		    radiusclient library.
		</simpara>
		<simpara>
		    Suppose that your SIP server is running on host
		    proxy.foo.bar and radiusclient library on that machine has
		    been configure with "foobarsecret" as the shared
		    secret. You need to put the following section into the
		    file:
		</simpara>
		<programlisting>
client proxy.foo.bar {
    secret = foobarsecret
    shortname = foo
}
		</programlisting>
		<simpara>
		    This fragment allows access from RADIUS clients on
		    proxy.foo.bar if they use "foobarsecret" as the shared
		    secret.
		</simpara>
		<note>
		    <simpara>
			The file already contains an entry for localhost (127.0.0.1), so if you are
			running the RADIUS server on the same host as your SIP server, then modify
			the existing entry instead. By default it contains shared secret
			"testing123".

		    File <filename>/usr/local/etc/raddb/dictionary</filename>
		    contains the dictionary of FreeRADIUS server. You have to
		    add the same dictionary file
		    (<filename>dictionary.ser</filename>), which you added to
		    the dictionary of radiusclient library, also here. In this
		    case you don't have to append the contents of the file, you
		    can include it into the main file.  Add the following line

		<programlisting>
$INCLUDE /usr/local/etc/radiusclient/dictionary.ser

		    un-comment them to enable digest authentication.
		</simpara>
		<note>
		    <simpara>
			There is also another line containing word "digest"
			followed by curly braces and it is enabled by
			default. The section is supposed to contain digest

	    <simpara>
		The basic configuration of FreeRADIUS server is done it now we
		are going to test if it really works. Start the server with
		parameter -X. That will cause the server to stay in the
		foreground (it will not turn into daemon) and produce a lot of
		debugging information on the standard output:

	    <screen>
root@/usr/local/src# radiusd -X

Digest-Algorithm = "MD5", Digest-User-Name = "test"

root@/usr/local/src# radclient -f digest localhost auth &lt;shared_secret&gt;
</screen>
	    <note>
		<simpara>
		    I suppose that you run the test utility directly on the
		    RADIUS server since it comes with the FreeRADIUS server
		    package. That also means that you have to enable access
		    from localhost in your <filename>clients.conf</filename>
		    file. Don't forget to replace &lt;shared_secret&gt; with
		    the shared secret configured for localhost clients in
		    <filename>clients.conf</filename>.

		Attribute "Sip-Rpid" is optional. The attribute

		<question>
		    <simpara>
			I compiled SIP-router RADIUS modules and installed
			radiusclient library, but when I try to start the server I get
			the following error message:
		    </simpara>
		    <programlisting>
libradiusclient.so.0: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
		    </programlisting>
		</question>
		<answer>
		    <simpara>
			Make sure that the directory which contains the library
			(usually <filename>/usr/local/lib</filename>) is listed
			in <filename>/etc/ld.so.conf</filename> and run
			<command>ldconfig -v</command> (as root).
		    </simpara>
		</answer>
	    </qandaentry>
	    <qandaentry>
		<question>
		    <simpara>
			I configured everything as described in this HOWTO, but
			I get the following message from radiusclient library
			"check_radius_reply: received invalid reply digest from
			RADIUS server". What does that mean ?
		    </simpara>
		</question>
		<answer>
		    <simpara>
			That means that radiusclient library was unable to
			verify digest of the RADIUS message (it is not related
			to SIP digest) because shared secret of the client
			and server do not match.
		    </simpara>
		    <note>
			<simpara>
			    FreeRADIUS server has two files that can contain

			    If you have proper shared secret in one file and you still get the
			    mentioned error message then check also the other file. This can easily
			    happen to clients running on the same host (127.0.0.1 or localhost),
			    because <filename>clients.conf</filename> contains
			    definition for localhost by default with secret "testing123".
