	    <question>
		<simpara>
		    Is it possible to use SER as a SIP user agent (both of User
		    Agent Client (UAC) and User Agent Server (UASS)?
		</simpara>
	    </question>
	    <answer>
		<simpara>
		    Not easily. SER has built-in some functions that allow to
		    use it as user agent, but our primary goal is to develop a
		    server so this is without guarantee and can even disappear
		    in future versions.
		</simpara>
	    </answer>
	</qandaentry>
	<qandaentry>
	    <question>
		<simpara>
		    Can SER work well together with some of the location server
		    (e. g.LDAP or DNS) ?
		</simpara>
	    </question>
	    <answer>
		<simpara>
		    SER's built-in location server uses
		    in-<acronym>RAM</acronym> database for high performance and
		    optionally MySQL for persistence. More database protocols
		    may be supplied on contractual basis. As far as I know,
		    <acronym>DNS</acronym> is not used in the industry for user
		    location.

	    <question>
		<simpara>
		    What is a proxy server ?
		</simpara>
	    </question>
	    <answer>
		<simpara>
		    A proxy server is an entity that routes SIP messages. See
		    SIP introduction which is part of the distribution.
		</simpara>
	    </answer>
	</qandaentry>
	<qandaentry>
	    <question>
	    	<simpara>
		    What is the difference between proxy server and back to back
		    user agent (B2BUA) ?
		</simpara>
	    </question>
	    <answer>
		<simpara>
		    The main difference is that proxy servers are
		    transaction-stateful, while B2BUAs are call stateful. That
		    means proxy servers keep state only during SIP transactions
		    (that is at the beginning and and of a call) and do not
		    keep any state during the whole call.
		</simpara>
		<simpara>
		    A B2BUA acts merely as connection of two or more user
		    agents which are connected through some means. B2BUAs keep
		    some state (usually some structures in the memory) during
		    the whole call.
		</simpara>
		<para>
		    This property gives B2BUA some interesting features that
		    proxies don't have. For example B2BUA can tear down and
		    existing call--proxies can't do that. On the other hand
		    B2BUAs can easily become a bottleneck in terms of
		    scalability.
		</para>
	    </answer>
	</qandaentry>
	<qandaentry>
	    <question>
		<simpara>
		    So is SER proxy or B2BUA ? Can it terminate an existing
		    call ?
		</simpara>
	    </question>
	    <answer>
		<simpara>
		    SER is a proxy. I can't terminate existing call.

	    <question>
		<simpara>
		    I'd like to know if SER supports <acronym>CPL</acronym> and
		    servlets. Where can I find any documentation about this, or
		    any link ?
		</simpara>
	    </question>
	    <answer>
		<simpara>
		    Yes, <acronym>CPL</acronym> is supported through cpl
		    module, the module needs an external <acronym>CPL</acronym>
		    interpreter written in Java. A C version is under
		    development. There is no support for Java servlets. The
		    documentation can be found at <ulink

	    <question>
		<simpara>
		    How does SER scale ?
		</simpara>
		<simpara>
		    SER is able to handle thousands calls per second on a regular

		<simpara>
		    I read <quote>Throughput thousands of calls per second
			(<acronym>CPS</acronym>) on a dual-<acronym>CPU</acronym>
			<acronym>PC</acronym></quote> on your webpage. How fast is it really ?
		</simpara>
	    </question>
	    <answer>
		<simpara>
		    Last time we have  checked ~4900cps on a dual Athlon MP2000.
		</simpara>
		<simpara>
		    This was ser 0.8.9 running statefully (stateless is should be much faster),
		    with 4 processes and 256 Mb shared mem.  It was compiled with: STATS:Off,
		    USE_IPV6, NO_DEBUG, SHM_MEM, SHM_MMAP, PKG_MALLOC, F_MALLOC,
		    FAST_LOCK-ADAPTIVE_WAIT ADAPTIVE_WAIT_LOOPS=1024, MAX_RECV_BUFFER_SIZE

		<simpara>
		    Do you have any recommendations on additional open source or developer
		    community resources to round out my platform?
		</simpara>
	    </question>
	    <answer>
		<simpara>
		    I'm a SER believer and think that other servers simply don't compare :) If
		    you wish more detailed propaganda, check our website and if that is not

	    <question>
		<simpara>
		    Do you have any thoughts on how it compares in
		    deployability and features to the Vovida stuff or other
		    options ? Also, are there any issues I should be thinking
		    of that would make a commercial venture with SER difficult
		    (licensing, scaling, etc..)
		</simpara>
	    </question>
	    <answer>
		<simpara>
		    SER is licensed under the GNU GPL. I would be surprised if
		    any SIP server available today would scale a bit better--we
		    spent lot of work on performance, achieved thousands of
		    <acronym>CPS</acronym> on a <acronym>PC</acronym>--I guess
		    it will take lot of time until your demand hits this
		    capacity.

		<simpara>
		    Is it necessary to have a <acronym>DNS SVR</acronym> Resource Record, as
		    mentioned in the ser-Howto guide for connecting to SER ?
		</simpara>
	    </question>
	    <answer>
		<simpara>
		    No. It's nice to have it, but you can work around it
		    setting a normal A record for your domain. The
		    <acronym>SRV</acronym> lookup will fall back to normal A
		    lookup.

		    We have a question regarding usrloc: where are the active sessions

		</simpara>
	    </question>
	    <answer>
		<simpara>
		    SER has no notion of active session. SER is a
		    transaction-stateful proxy, that means it knows about
		    transactions (INVITE transaction, BYE transaction), but it
		    keeps no state if there is no transaction active.
		</simpara>
		<simpara>
		    That means, it keeps state when an INVITE comes and until a
		    final response to the INVITE is sent. The same for BYE.

		<simpara>
		    How do we deal with aliases? If for example uid=mic is

		    michael.dosser@comnect.at how is this accomplished with ser
		    ?
		</simpara>
	    </question>
	    <answer>
		<simpara>
		    Aliases are tied to user location. It uses a special table
		    which has the same structure as user location table and
		    includes an entry for each alias. You do not have to do
		    something special for that. You have to create this table
		    and then you can use serctl to add aliases.

		    When using the Jabber Gateway, some users get the following

		<simpara>
		    ERROR: Connection to Jabber server lost. You have to login

		</simpara>
	    </question>
	    <answer>
		<simpara>
		    that usually occurs because Jabber server crashes or, for

		<simpara>
		    There is no way to disable sending these messages. I may

		    Is there an example of the session timer with SER somewhere?
		</simpara>
	    </question>
	    <answer>
		<simpara>
		    That's a theoretical SIP option today, SER is not supporting
		    session-timer.  We gave it a try more than one year ago and gave up due to
		    interop problems.  The specification was developing at that time so quickly
		    that there was not any UA which would work with another one correctly.
		</simpara>
		<simpara>
		    Once the interoperability gets better, it could be worth implementing. It is
		    in general a nice mechanism for avoiding session state silo in network,
		    which is good for scalability.

		</simpara>
	    </question>
	    <answer>
		<simpara>
		    If you are using 0.8.10, it is a manual process--copy and paste
		    <acronym>SQL</acronym> tables, have a table set for each served domain, and
		    refer to the table names from your scripts. E.g.,
		</simpara>
		<simpara>
		    if (uri=~"domain1.com") { lookup("domain1"); ...
		</simpara>
		<simpara>
		    With 0.8.11 you can automate the process quite a lot. Authorization
		    functions with realm set to empty value take domain name from SIP
		    requests. User location database keeps track of domains as well. The
		    "domain" modules allows you to keep track of maintained domains
		    in a way which does not take changing scripts.
		</simpara>
		<simpara>
		    It is possible there are some magic options in domain/usrloc/auth_db/
		    registrar/auth modules you need to turn on to enable multidomain
		    operation--I don't remember these by heart, hopefully some people
		    on the mailing list do.

		    Which database engine should I use ?
		</simpara>
	    </question>
	    <answer>
		<simpara>
		    That depends on your requirements. Performance aspects are probably not very
		    important. The most stable and proven is MySQL module. Also serctl utility works
		    well with this database.
		</simpara>
		<simpara>
		    Another option is postgres support which was donated by Greg Fausak. The module
		    still new and not that mature (read proven) yet. People using the module
		    reported that it worked well.
		</simpara>
		<simpara>
		    Last option is dbtext module which uses plaintext files to store the data. This
		    module is somewhat experimental and shouldn't be used for any serious
		    deployment. The module is quite slow, but it can fit well into small
		    installations containing only a couple of users or demos where you need to change
		    the content of the database often by hand.
