<para>Sometimes it is needed to solve problems with presence related stuff...

<para>
<itemizedlist>

	<listitem><para>AVPs might not work properly with presence. If you create
	AVPs they can disappear after call to handle_subscription or similar
	function. The reason is that from such functions is created new transaction
	(sent a NOTIFY request) and AVPs are not returned correctly to previous
	one.</para></listitem>

	<listitem><para>There are some standard incompliances in presence modules, 
	often caused by standard ambiguity or contradiction or by partial 
	implementation only. Please refer to specific
	module documentation in such situations.</para></listitem>
	<listitem><para>SIP clients often use broken data, not corresponding with
	the data format specification. Look into the specification in such cases (for
	example <xref linkend="pres_rfc_pidf"/>).</para></listitem>

	<listitem><para>The XCAP module is incompatible with TLS module due to Openssl
	initialization!</para>
	<para>XCAP module uses libcurl for HTTP communication and libcurl is using
	libopenssl internaly. But the TLS module needs some extra openssl initialization which
	is not working when libcurl initializes Openssl by itself.</para>
	<para>Thanks Samuel (samu60@gmail.com) for pointing this out.</para></listitem>

<section><title>Reporting problems</title>
<para>If you can not find the source of your problem or if you are not sure how
to do this or that, you can: 
<itemizedlist>
	<listitem><para>Try to search for similar problem in mailing lists on
	<ulink url="http://www.sip-router.org/">SIP-router's main page</ulink> or in
	<ulink url="http://lists.kamailio.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/">list archives</ulink>.
	</para></listitem>

	<listitem><para>Send an email to <ulink
	url="mailto:sr-users@lists.kamailio.org">sr-users@lists.kamailio.org</ulink> for
	user related problem or
	<ulink url="mailto:sr-dev@lists.kamailio.org">sr-dev@lists.kamailio.org</ulink>
	for development related things. There are lots of interesting people on
	these lists with lots of experiences with SIP related stuff ;-).
	</para></listitem>

	<listitem><para>For presence-only related things you can send me an email
	directly to vaclav.kubart@iptel.org, but I highly prefer to use one of
	mailing lists above because many people may be interested in the same
	problem as you have.</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>
</para>

<para>If you find a bug, please report it to our <ulink
url="http://sip-router.org/tracker/">bug tracker</ulink>
or send an email to lists mentioned above or directly to me (email above).</para>

</section>

<section><title>New features</title>
<para>There is a list of features to be implemented in my TODO list. I will put them
into our bug tracker as soon as I will have more time for it. ;-)
</para>

<para>If you are interested in a feature you can search or ask in mailing lists
or you can add your feature into bug tracker and might be that it will be
implemented or at least discussed.
</para>
</section> <!-- new features -->

<section><title>Searching a problem</title>
<para>Most of presence modules have <quote>trace</quote> method which can be
invoked through SIP-router's management interface. Such methods often dumps current status,
existing subscriptions etc.
</para>

<para>For calling management methods you can simply use set of
<application>sercmd</application> utilities (don't mess with deprecated serctl
utility which is from unknown reason still installed with SIP-router) or
<application>binrpc</application> which uses more effective binary
protocol.</para>
