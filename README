V.	More Information


 SIP Express Router (SER) is an industrial-strength, free VoIP 
server based on the session initiation protocol (SIP RFC2543-bis). 
It is engineered to power IP telephony infrastructures up to large 
scale. The server keeps track of users, sets up VoIP sessions, 
relays instant messages and creates space for new plug-in applications. 
Its proven interoperability guarantees seamless integration with 
components from other vendors, eliminating the risk of a single-vendor 
trap. It has successfully participated in various interoperability 
tests in which it worked with the products of other leading SIP vendors.

The SIP Express Router enables a flexible plug-in model for new 
applications: Third parties can easily link their plug-ins with 
the server code and provide thereby advanced and customized services. 
In this way, plug-ins such as SNMP support, RADIUS accounting,
or SMS gateway have already been developed and are provided as 
advanced features. Other modules are underway: Presence server,
firewall control, and more.

Its performance and robustness allows it to serve millions of users and 
accommodate needs of very large operators. With a $3000 dual-CPU, the 
SIP Express Router is able to power IP telephony services in an area 
as large as the Bay Area during peak hours. Even on an IPAQ PDA, the server 
withstands 150 calls per second (CPS)! The server has been powering our 
iptel.org free SIP site withstanding heavy daily load that is further 
increasing with the popularity of Microsoft's Messenger.  

The SIP Express Router is extremely configurable to allow the creation of 
various routing and admission policies as well as setting up new and 
customized services. Its configurability allows it to serve many roles: 
network security barrier, application server, or PSTN gateway guard for 
example.


II. Feature List

Based on the latest standards, the SIP Express Router (SER) includes 
support for registrar, proxy and redirect mode. Further it acts as 
an application server with support for CPL, instant messaging and 
presence (IM&P) including a 2G/SMS gateway, a call control policy 
language, call number translation, private dial plans and accounting, 
authorization and authentication (AAA) services. SER runs on Sun/Solaris, 
PC/Linux, IPAQ/Linux platforms and supports  both IPv4 and IPv6.


III. About iptel.org

iptel.org is a know-how company spun off from Germany's national 
research company FhG Fokus. One of the first SIP implementations ever, 
low-QoS enhancements, interoperability tests and VoIP-capable firewall 
control concepts are examples of well-known FhG's work.

iptel.org continues to keep this know-how leadership in SIP. 
The access rate of the company's site, a well-known source of 
technological information, is a best proof of interest. Thousands 
of hits come every day from the whole Internet.
