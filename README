I. About Kamailio
=================

Kamailio is an industrial-strength, free server for realtime communication,
based on the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP RFC3261).

It is engineered to power Realtime Communications such as IP telephony and
presence infrastructures up to large scale. With embedded support for
WebSockets/WebRTC, HTTP, XSRP and XMLrpc as well as Json-rpc it's a modern
server, up to date with current standards on IPv4/IPv6 and TLS security.

Kamailio keeps track of users, sets up multimedia sessions, relays instant
messages and creates space for new plug-in applications. Its proven
interoperability guarantees seamless integration with components from other
vendors, eliminating the risk of a single-vendor trap. Kamailio has
successfully participated in various interoperability tests in which it worked
with the products of other leading SIP vendors.

The Kamailio software enables a flexible plug-in model for new applications:
third parties can easily link their plug-ins with the server code and provide
thereby advanced and customized services. With a modern RPC interface, 3rd
party application can integrate and interact with services provided by
Kamailio. By using the EVAPI interface or the embedded HTTP server restful
applications can be built.

Kamailio's performance and robustness allows it to serve millions of users and
accommodate needs of very large operators. With a low-cost dual-CPU, the
Kamailio server is able to power IP telephony services in an area as large as
the Bay Area during peak hours.

The Kamailio server is extremely configurable to allow the creation of various
routing and admission policies as well as setting up new and customized
services. Its configurability  allows it to serve many roles: network security
barrier, presence server, application server,  IMS server or PSTN gateway guard
(Edge Proxy / Session Border Controller) for example.


II. Feature List
================

Please visit https://www.kamailio.org/ for the most up-to-date feature list.
Note that as features easily are added as modules, changes can occur quickly.

Most of Kamailio's features are implemented as plug-in modules. See
our web site for a current list.

III. Getting started
====================

The documentation wiki is an important source of tutorials for installing
and understanding how Kamailio works:

  * https://www.kamailio.org/wiki/

The INSTALL document provides more details and guidelines that will help with
the installation.

Kamailio is composed of a core and additional modules. For each module
there is a README with documentation on how to configure and use the
module. These are available in each modules source code directory as well
as on the kamailio.org web site.

We recommend that you continue with reading README-MODULES and then the
document named INSTALL.

IV. About kamailio.org
========================

The Kamailio project has roots in a line of projects starting with SIP Express
Router, then OpenSER and now Kamailio. A merge project was started during the
fall of 2008 by developers from the OpenSER project, recently renamed to
Kamailio.org, and SIP Express Router (SER) from iptel.org.

Kamailio is the result of a merge of the code base and years of experience from
both developer teams. During the development of the release 4.0, autumn-winter
of 2012, the merger of the products was completed and a unified product was
released.

See http://www.kamailio.org/ for the story of SER, OpenSER and Kamailio.
