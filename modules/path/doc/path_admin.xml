		<title>Overview</title>
		<para>
		This module is designed to be used at intermediate sip proxies like loadbalancers in front of
		registrars and proxies. It provides functions for inserting a Path header including a parameter for
		passing forward the received-&uri; of a registration to the next hop. It also provides a mechanism
		for evaluating this parameter in subsequent requests and to set the destination &uri; according to it.
		</para>
		<section>
			<title>Path insertion for registrations</title>
			<para>
			For registrations in a scenario like <quote>[UAC] -> [P1] -> [REG]</quote>, 
			the "path" module can be used at the intermediate proxy P1 to insert a Path
			header into the message before forwarding it to the registrar REG. Two functions
			can be used to achieve this:
			<itemizedlist>
				<listitem>
					<para>
					<emphasis>add_path(...)</emphasis> adds a Path header in the form of
					<quote>Path: &lt;sip:1.2.3.4;lr&gt;</quote> to the message using the address
					of the outgoing interface. A port is only added if it's not the default
					port 5060.
					</para>
					<para>
					If a username is passed to the function, it is also included in the Path
					&uri;, like <quote>Path: &lt;sip:username@1.2.3.4;lr&gt;</quote>.
					</para>
				</listitem>

				<listitem>
					<para>
					<emphasis>add_path_received(...)</emphasis> also add a Path header in the
					same form as above, but also adds a parameter indicating the received-&uri;
					of the message, like 
					<quote>Path: &lt;sip:1.2.3.4;received=sip:2.3.4.5:1234;lr&gt;</quote>. This
					is especially useful if the proxy does NAT detection and wants to pass
					the NAT'ed address to the registrar.
					</para>
					<para>
					If the function is called with a username, it's included in the Path &uri; too.
					</para>
				</listitem>
			</itemizedlist>
			</para>
			<para>
			</para>

		<section>
			<title>Outbound routing to NAT'ed UACs</title>
			<para>
			If the NAT'ed address of an UAC is passed to the registrar, the registrar routes back
			subsequent requests using the Path header of the registration as Route header of the
			current request. If the intermediate proxy had inserted a Path header including the
			<quote>received</quote> parameter during the registration, this parameter will show up
			in the Route header of the new request as well, allowing the intermediate proxy to route
			to this address instead of the one propagated in the Route &uri; for tunneling through NAT.
			This behaviour can be activated by setting the module parameter <quote>use_received</quote>.

		<title><varname>use_received</varname> (int)</title>
		<para>
		If set to 1, the <quote>received</quote> parameter of the first Route &uri; is evaluated and
		used as destination-&uri; if present.
		</para>
		<para>
		<emphasis>
			Default value is 0.

		<title>
		<function moreinfo="none">add_path()</function>
		</title>
		<para>
		This function is used to insert a Path header in the form 
		<quote>Path: &lt;sip:1.2.3.4;lr&gt;</quote>, where <quote>1.2.3.4</quote> is the address
		of the outgoing interface.
		</para>
		<para>
		If the <quote>outbound</quote> module was loaded before this module, and outbound is
		required for this request, the header will be in the form
		<quote>Path: &lt;sip:flowtoken@1.2.3.4;lr;ob&gt;</quote>, where <quote>flowtoken</quote>
		is the RFC 5636 flow-token that can be used to identify the source and local address and
		transport the request was received on, and where <quote>1.2.3.4</quote> is the address of
		the outgoing interface.
