	<para>
		ACC module is used to account transactions information to different
		backends like syslog, <abbrev>SQL</abbrev>,
		<acronym>RADIUS</acronym> and <acronym>DIAMETER</acronym> 
		(beta version).
	</para>
	<para>
		To account a transaction and to choose which set of backends to be 
		used, the script writer just has to set some flags (see the module
		parameters section for flag definitions <xref linkend="acc.i.params"/>).
		If the accounting flag for a specific backend is set, the acc module 
		will then report on completed transaction. A typical usage of the 
		module takes no acc-specific script command -- the functionality 
		binds invisibly through transaction processing. Script writers just 
		need to mark the transaction for accounting with proper setflag. 
		Even so, the module allows the script writter to force accounting in 
		special cases via some script functions.
	</para>
	<para>
		The accounting module will log by default a fixed set of attributes 
		for the transaction - if you customize your accounting by adding more
		information to be logged, please see the next chapter about extra
		accounting - <xref linkend="acc.i.extra-accounting"/>.

			If a UA fails in middle of conversation, a proxy will never

			end-device (such as PSTN gateway), which best knows about call 
			status (including media status and PSTN status in case of the 
			gateway). However, CDR-base logging has the option to log existing
			information from expired dialogs (the dlg_vars in cdr_extra)
			Please see cdr_expired_dlg_enable parameter - <xref linkend="acc.p.cdr_expired_dlg_enable"/>.

		The SQL backend support is compiled in the module. For RADIUS and
		DIAMETER you need to enable it by recompiling the module with properly
		set defines: uncomment the RAD_ACC or DDIAM_ACC lines in
		modules/acc/Makefile. To compile RADIUS support, 
		you need to have radiusclient-ng (only versions higher or equal 
		to 0.5.0) installed on your system which is available from
		<ulink url='http://developer.berlios.de/projects/radiusclient-ng/'>
		http://developer.berlios.de/projects/radiusclient-ng/</ulink>.
		The radius client needs to be configured properly. To do so, use the 
		template at etc/radiusclient.conf and make sure
		that module's radius_config parameter points to its location.
		In particular, accounting secret must match that one configured in
		server and proper dictionary is used (one is available at 
		etc/sip_dictionary). Also note that Debian radiusclient-ng uses
		/var/run/radius.seq as seqfile but &kamailio; Debian init script expects
		/var/run/kamailio/kamailio_radius.seq, so is needed to change it in
		radiusclient-ng configuration or in &kamailio; Debian init script (if not,
		&kamailio; can't create the seq file when not running as root). Uses along
		with FreeRadius (<ulink url='http://www.freeradius.org/'>
		http://www.freeradius.org/</ulink>) and Radiator 
		(<ulink url='http://www.open.com.au/radiator/'>
		http://www.open.com.au/radiator/</ulink>) servers have been
		reported to us.
        </para>
	<para>
	NOTE: diameter support was developed for DISC (DIameter Server Client 
	project at http://developer.berlios.de/projects/disc/). This project 
	seems to be no longer maintained and DIAMETER specifications were updated
	in the meantime. Thus, the DIAMETER part in the module is obsolete and 
	needs rework to be usable with opendiameter or other DIAMETER servers.

		<title>Multi Call-Legs accounting</title>
		<section>
			<title>Overview</title>
			<para>
			A SIP call can have multiple legs due forwarding actions. For 
			example user A calls user B which forwards the call to user C. 
			There is only one SIP call but with 2 legs ( A to B and B to C). 
			Accounting the legs of a call is required for proper billing of 
			the calls (if C is a PSTN number and the call is billed, user B 
			must pay for the call - as last party modifing the call 
			destination-, and not A - as initiator of the call. Call 
			forwarding on server is only one example which shows the 
			necessity of the having an accounting engine with multiple legs 
			support.
			</para>
		</section>
		<section>
			<title>Configuration</title>
			<para>
			First how it works: The idea is to have a set of AVPs and for each
			call leg to store a set of values in the AVPs. The meaning of
			the AVP content is stricly decided by the script writer - it can
			be the origin and source of the leg, its status or any other 
			related information. If you have a set of 4 AVPS (AVP1, AVP2, AVP3,
			AVP4), then for the "A call B and B forwards to C" example, 
			you need to set a different set of values for the AVPs
			for each leg ([A,B] and [B,C]) .
			The script writer must take care and properly insert all 
			these AVP from the script (in proper order and with the correct type).
			</para>
			<para>
			When the accounting information for the call will be written/sent, 
			all the call-leg pairs will be added (based on the found AVP sets).
			</para>
			<para>
			By default, the multiple call-leg support is disabled - it can be
			enabled just be setting the per-leg set of AVPs via the 
			<varname>multi_leg_info</varname> module parameter.
			</para>
		</section>
		<section>
			<title>Logged data</title>

		<title>Call Data Record generation</title>
        <section>
            <title>Overview</title>
                <para>
                In addition to transaction-based logging, it is possible to generate and log Call Data
                Records (CDRs) directly from &kamailio;. Apart from a basic set of CDR fields which
                are always included (covering start time, end time, and duration), the approach allows
                flexible specification of additional fields that should be taken into account using
                the configuration script. This is very similar to how transaction-based logging may
                be customized with the exception that CDRs rely on dialogs instead of transactions
                to store relevant information during a call.
                </para>

                <para>
                In order to set up CDR generation, you must enable the CDR switch and load the dialog
                module. You probably also want to specify a set of pseudo-variables that define more
                relevant CDR fields. Pseudo-variables may be assigned arbitrarily during script
                execution, and the module will make sure that the variable content will be transformed
                into a CDR by the end of the dialog.
                </para>

                <para>
                To use CDR logging in a correct manner, you should only use the dialog-based
                pseudo-variables (dlg_var) from the dialog module. This allows you to save values
                right from the beginning through all requests and replies until termination of the
                call. While not recommended, it is still possible to use other pseudo-variables as
                well. Except for pseudo-variables valid in the call-final transaction, however,
                information given will not be stored in the CDR as they cannot be accessed by the
                end of the call when the CDR is logged.
                </para>

                <para>
				Sometimes, dialogs expire because the UA has a problem and a final message is never
				transmitted. You can toggle on/off the generation of CDR-based logging in such cases
				with only the dlg_vars showing by using the cdr_expired_dlg_enable parameter
				- <xref linkend="acc.p.cdr_expired_dlg_enable"/>. Default behavior is not logging.

			<title>CDR with Multi Call-Legs</title>
			<section>
				<title>Overview</title>
				<para>
				As mentioned in <xref linkend="acc.i.multi-call-legs"/>, a leg represents a parallel
				or forwarded call. In contrast to the normal accounting the cdr logging uses dialogs
				instead of transaction to log data. This may reduce the amount of information 
				but it also make it possible to combine all important data in one cdr at 
				once. A second mechanism to process multiple data-sets into one cdr is not further
				necessary.
				</para>
			</section>
			<section>
				<title>Configuration</title>
				<para>
				When you route messages multiple times through your proxy (e.g. to
				handle <quote>call-forwardings</quote>) you have to use detect_spirals
				from the dialog modules. Otherwise the proxy can't identify and reuse existing
				dialogs.
				</para>
				<para>
				To get the correct call-forwarding-chain you have to store each cf* with the
				corresponding caller and callee in a dialog based pseudo-variable (dlg_var)
				(e.g. chain=B;cfa;C|C;cfnr;D). Additionally it is necessary to store the
				caller and callee for each leg. All this helps to identify the involved
				phone parners and forwarding chain. When you route such calls multiple times
				to the same Proxy, you could store the caller and callee within an transaction
				based avp and write it into the dialog based dlg_var pv during a 200 INVITE.
