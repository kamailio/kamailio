1. Overview

   This is a module which provides Oracle connectivity for Kamailio. It
   implements the DB API defined in Kamailio. If you want to use the
   nathelper module, or any other modules that calls the get_all_ucontacts
   API export from usrloc, then you need to set the DORACLE_USRLOC define
   in the Makefile.defs file before compilation.

2. Dependencies

   2.1. Kamailio Modules
   2.2. External Libraries or Applications

2.1. Kamailio Modules

   The following modules must be loaded before this module:
     * No dependencies on other Kamailio modules.

2.2. External Libraries or Applications

   The following libraries or applications must be installed before
   running Kamailio with this module loaded:
     * instantclient-sdk-10.2.0.3 - the development headers and libraries
       of OCI.

3. Parameters

   3.1. timeout (fixedpoint)
   3.2. reconnect (fixedpoint)

3.1. timeout (fixedpoint)

   Timeout value for any operation with BD.

   Possible values is from 0.1 to 10.0 seconds.

   Default value is 3.0 (3 second).

   If value of timeout parameter set to 0, module use synchronous mode
   (without timeout).

   Example 1.1. Set timeout parameter
...
modparam("db_oracle", "timeout", 1.5)
...

   Example 1.2. Disable asynchronous mode
...
modparam("db_oracle", "timeout", 0)
...

3.2. reconnect (fixedpoint)

   Timeout value for connect (create session) operation.

   Possible values is from 0.1 to 10.0 seconds.

   Default value is 0.2 (200 milliseconds).

   Example 1.3. Set reconnect parameter
...
modparam("db_oracle", "reconnect", 0.5)
...

4. Functions

   No function exported to be used from configuration file.

5. Installation

   Because it dependes on an external library, the oracle module is not
   compiled and installed by default. You can use one of the next options.
     * - edit the "Makefile" and remove "db_oracle" from
       "excluded_modules" list. Then follow the standard procedure to
       install Kamailio: "make all; make install".
     * - from command line use: 'make all include_modules="db_oracle";
       make install include_modules="db_oracle"'.

6. Utility openser_orasel

   For working with kamctl script, should be able to print the 'query'
   results to the terminal in a user-readable form. The standard
   command-line Oracle client (sqlplus) is not quite suitable for this, as
   it cannot align row width to real (received) data's (it always prints a
   cell width as described in the db scheme). This problem has been solved
   by inclusion the utility openser_orasel, which formats printing
   approximately in the same way as the 'mysql' client utility. In
   addition, this utility known about the "agreements and types" in DB
   that are used in Kamailio for the work with Oracle and formats printing
   taking these into account.
