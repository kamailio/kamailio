1. Overview

   This module is able to detect compressed body in received SIP message
   and decompress it as well as compress the body for outgoing SIP
   message. It works also for received HTTP request and replied HTTP
   response (Kamailio cannot work in HTTP proxy mode).

   The decision of whether to do compression or decompression is made by
   detecting a special SIP header (default 'Content-Encoding') that
   matches a given value - both header name and value can be set via
   module parameters. If a SIP message is received with clear body and you
   want to compress the body for outgoing, add the header in config file.
   The header can be added to the local generated replies as well.

   In other words, if the header is present in incoming SIP message, its
   body is decompressed. If the header is present in outgoing SIP message,
   its body is compressed. Therefore inside configuration file, the body
   is in original format(e.g., plain text). In this way, the existing
   functions to handle content of the body work as usual (e.g., to strip
   codecs in sdp via sdpops or do substitutions via textops).

   The functions used to compress and decompress are from zlib library
   (http://zlib.net).

   NOTE: for the moment the module cannot be used with topoh module,
   overlapping in core event callbacks (will be fixed soon).

   The immediate benefit of compressing the body is to reduce the size of
   the SIP message, increasing the chances to stay under MTU for UDP
   packts. From observation, the compressed body is in between 50% to 67%
   smaller than the original size (e.g., a body of 431 bytes was
   compressed to 230).

   An use case can be when having peering traffic between two Kamailio
   servers. Before relaying to the other Kamailio, use in config file:
   append_hf("Content-Encoding: deflate\r\n").

2. Dependencies

   2.1. Kamailio Modules
   2.2. External Libraries or Applications

2.1. Kamailio Modules

   The following modules must be loaded before this module:
     * none.

2.2. External Libraries or Applications

   The following libraries or applications must be installed before
   running Kamailio with this module loaded:
     * zlib compression library (http://zlib.net).

3. Parameters

   3.1. header_name (str)
   3.2. header_value (str)
   3.3. sanity_checks (integer)

3.1. header_name (str)

   Name of the header that indicates compression or decompression has to
   be done.

   Default value is "Content-Encoding".

   Example 1.1. Set header_name parameter
...
modparam("gzcompress", "header_name", "Encoded")
...

3.2. header_value (str)

   Value of the header that indicates compression or decompression has to
   be done.

   Default value is "deflate".

   Example 1.2. Set header_value parameter
...
modparam("gzcompress", "header_value", "gzip")
...

3.3. sanity_checks (integer)

   If set to 1, gzcompress module will bind to sanity module in order to
   perform sanity checks over received SIP request. Default sanity checks
   are done. It is useful to check if received request is well formated
   before proceeding to encoding/decoding.

   Default value is 0 (do not bind to sanity module).

   Example 1.3. Set sanity_checks parameter
...
modparam("gzcompress", "sanity_checks", 1)
...

4. Functions

   None.

5. Config File

   Next example shows how to enable compression for forwarded requests, as
   well as replying with compressed body for HTTP requests. For SIP, the
   request is recevied and forwarded to itself once, just for the sake of
   showing a simple example.
