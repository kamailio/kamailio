	<title>Overview</title>
	<para>
		This is a module that enables media streams to be proxied
		via an &rtp; proxy. The only &rtp; proxy currently known to work
		with this module is the Sipwise rtpengine
		<ulink url="https://github.com/sipwise/rtpengine"></ulink>.
		The rtpengine module is a modified version of the original
		rtpproxy module using a new control protocol. The module is
		designed to be a drop-in replacement for the old module from
		a configuration file point of view, however due to the
		incompatible control protocol, it only works with &rtp; proxies
		which specifically support it.
	</para>
	</section>

	<section>
	<title>Multiple &rtp; proxy usage</title>
	<para>
		The rtpengine module can support multiple &rtp; proxies for
		balancing/distribution and control/selection purposes.
	</para>
	<para>
		The module allows definition of several sets of rtpproxies.
		Load-balancing will be performed over a set and the admin has the
		ability to choose what set should be used. The set is selected via
		its id - the id being defined with the set. Refer to the
		<quote>rtpengine_sock</quote> module parameter definition for syntax
		description.
	</para>
	<para>
		The balancing inside a set is done automatically by the module based on
		the weight of each &rtp; proxy from the set.
	</para>
	<para>
		The selection of the set is done from script prior using
		rtpengine_delete(), rtpengine_offer() or rtpengine_answer()
		functions - see the set_rtpengine_set() function.
	</para>
	<para>
	        Another way to select the set is to define setid_avp
	        module parameter and assign setid to the defined avp
	        before calling rtpengine_offer() or rtpengine_manage()
	        function.  If forwarding of the requests fails and
	        there is another branch to try, remember to unset the
	        avp after calling rtpengine_delete() function.
	</para>
	<para>
		For backward compatibility reasons, a set with no id take by default
		the id 0. Also if no set is explicitly set before
		rtpengine_delete(), rtpengine_offer() or rtpengine_answer()
		the 0 id set will be used.
	</para>
	<para>
		IMPORTANT: if you use multiple sets, take care and use the same set for
		both rtpengine_offer()/rtpengine_answer() and rtpengine_delete()!!
		If the set was selected using setid_avp, the avp needs to be
		set only once before rtpengine_offer() or rtpengine_manage() call.

		when SDPs are in 200 OK and ACK.
                </para>
		<para>Meaning of the parameters is as follows:</para>
		<itemizedlist>
		<listitem>
			<para>
			<emphasis>flags</emphasis> - flags to turn on some features.
			</para>
			<para>The <quote>flags</quote> string is a list of space-separated items. Each item
			is either an individual token, or a token in <quote>key=value</quote> format. The
			possible tokens are described below.</para>
			<itemizedlist>
				<listitem><para>
				<emphasis>via-branch=...</emphasis> - Include the <quote>branch</quote>
				value of one of the <quote>Via</quote> headers in the request to the
				&rtp; proxy. Possible values are:
				<quote>1</quote> - use the first <quote>Via</quote> header;
				<quote>2</quote> - use the second <quote>Via</quote> header;
				<quote>auto</quote> - use the first <quote>Via</quote> header if this is
				a request, or the second one if this is a reply;
				<quote>extra</quote> - don't take the value from a header, but instead use
				the value of the <quote>extra_id_pv</quote> variable.
				This can be used to create one media session per branch
				on the &rtp; proxy. When sending a subsequent <quote>delete</quote> command to
				the &rtp; proxy, you can then stop just the session for a specific branch when
				passing the flag '1' or '2' in the <quote>rtpengine_delete</quote>, or stop
				all sessions for a call when not passing one of those two flags there. This is
				especially useful if you have serially forked call scenarios where the &rtp; proxy
				gets an <quote>offer</quote> command for a new branch, and then a
				<quote>delete</quote> command for the previous branch, which would otherwise
				delete the full call, breaking the subsequent <quote>answer</quote> for the
				new branch. <emphasis>This flag is only supported by the Sipwise rtpengine
				&rtp; proxy at the moment!</emphasis>
				</para></listitem>
				<listitem><para>
				<emphasis>asymmetric</emphasis> - flags that UA from which message is
				received doesn't support symmetric RTP. (automatically sets the 'r' flag)
				</para></listitem>
				<listitem><para>
				<emphasis>force-answer</emphasis> - force <quote>answer</quote>, that is,
				only rewrite &sdp; when corresponding session already exists
				in the &rtp; proxy. By default is on when the session is to be
				completed.
				</para></listitem>
				<listitem><para>
				<emphasis>internal, external</emphasis> - these flags specify the direction of
				the SIP message. These flags only make sense when the &rtp; proxy is running
				in bridge mode. <quote>internal</quote> corresponds to the proxy's first
				interface, <quote>external</quote> corresponds to the &rtp; proxy's
				second interface. You always have to specify two flags to define
				the incoming network and the outgoing network. For example, <quote>internal
				external</quote> should be
				used for SIP message received from the local interface and sent out on the
				external interface, and <quote>external internal</quote> vice versa. Other
				options are <quote>internal internal</quote> and <quote>external
				external</quote>.
				So, for example if a SIP requests is processed with <quote>internal
				external</quote> flags, the corresponding
				response must be processed with <quote>internal external</quote> flags.
				</para></listitem>
				<listitem><para>
				<emphasis>auto-bridge</emphasis> - this flag an alternative to the
				<quote>internal</quote> and <quote>external</quote> flags
				in order to do automatic bridging between IPv4 on the
				"internal network" and IPv6 on the "external network". Instead of
				explicitly instructing the &rtp; proxy to select a particular address
				family, the distinction is done by the given IP in the SDP body by
				the RTP proxy itself. Not supported by Sipwise rtpengine.
				</para></listitem>
				<listitem><para>
				<emphasis>address-family=...</emphasis> - instructs the &rtp; proxy that the
				recipient of this &sdp; body expects to see addresses of a particular family.
				Possible values are <quote>IP4</quote> and <quote>IP6</quote>. For example,
				if the &sdp; body contains IPv4 addresses but the recipient only speaks IPv6,
				you would use <quote>address-family=IP6</quote> to bridge between the two
				address families.
				</para><para>
				Sipwise rtpengine remembers the address family preference of each party after
				it has seen an &sdp; body from them. This means that normally it is only
				necessary to explicitly specify the address family in the <quote>offer</quote>,
				but not in the <quote>answer</quote>.
				</para><para>
				Note: Please note, that this will only work properly with non-dual-stack user-agents or with
				dual-stack clients according to RFC6157 (which suggest ICE for Dual-Stack implementations).
				This short-cut will not work properly with RFC4091 (ANAT) compatible clients, which suggests
				having different m-lines with different IP-protocols grouped together.
				</para></listitem>
				<listitem><para>
				<emphasis>force</emphasis> - instructs the &rtp; proxy to ignore marks
				inserted by another &rtp; proxy in transit to indicate that the
				session is already goes through another proxy. Allows creating
				a chain of proxies. Not supported and ignored by Sipwise rtpengine.
				</para></listitem>
				<listitem><para>
				<emphasis>trust-address</emphasis> - flags that IP address in SDP should
				be trusted. Without this flag, the &rtp; proxy ignores address in
				the SDP and uses source address of the SIP message as media
				address which is passed to the RTP proxy.
				</para></listitem>
				<listitem><para>
				<emphasis>replace-origin</emphasis> - flags that IP from the origin
				description (o=) should be also changed.
				</para></listitem>
				<listitem><para>
				<emphasis>replace-session-connection</emphasis> - flags to change the session-level
				SDP connection (c=) IP if media description also includes
				connection information.
				</para></listitem>
				<listitem><para>
				<emphasis>symmetric</emphasis> - flags that for the UA from which
				message is received, support symmetric RTP must be forced.
				</para></listitem>
				<listitem><para>
				<emphasis>repacketize=NN</emphasis> - requests the &rtp; proxy to perform
				re-packetization of RTP traffic coming from the UA which
				has sent the current message to increase or decrease payload
				size per each RTP packet forwarded if possible.  The NN is the
				target payload size in ms, for the most codecs its value should
				be in 10ms increments, however for some codecs the increment
				could differ (e.g. 30ms for GSM or 20ms for G.723).  The
				&rtp; proxy would select the closest value supported by the codec.
				This feature could be used for significantly reducing bandwith
				overhead for low bitrate codecs, for example with G.729 going
				from 10ms to 100ms saves two thirds of the network bandwith.
				Not supported by Sipwise rtpengine.
				</para></listitem>
				<listitem><para>
				<emphasis>ICE=...</emphasis> - controls the &rtp; proxy's behaviour
				regarding ICE attributes within the &sdp; body. Possible values
				are: <quote>force</quote> -
				discard any ICE attributes already present in the &sdp; body
				and then generate and insert new ICE data, leaving itself
				as the <emphasis>only</emphasis> ICE candidates;
				<quote>remove</quote> instructs the &rtp; proxy to discard
				any ICE attributes and not insert any new ones into the &sdp;.
				The default (if no <quote>ICE=...</quote> is given at all),
				new ICE data will only be generated
				if no ICE was present in the &sdp; originally; otherwise
				the &rtp; proxy will only insert itself as an
				<emphasis>additional</emphasis> ICE candidate. Other
				&sdp; substitutions (c=, m=, etc) are unaffected by this flag.
				</para></listitem>
				<listitem><para>
				<emphasis>RTP, SRTP, AVP, AVPF</emphasis> - These flags control the &rtp;
				transport protocol that should be used towards the recipient of
				the &sdp;. If none of them are specified, the protocol given in
				the &sdp; is left untouched. Otherwise, the <quote>SRTP</quote> flag indicates that
				SRTP should be used, while <quote>RTP</quote> indicates that SRTP should not be used.
				<quote>AVPF</quote> indicates that the advanced RTCP profile with feedback messages
				should be used, and <quote>AVP</quote> indicates that the regular RTCP profile
				should be used. See also the next set of flags below.
				</para></listitem>
				<listitem><para>
				<emphasis>RTP/AVP, RTP/SAVP, RTP/AVPF, RTP/SAVPF</emphasis> - these serve as
				an alternative, more explicit way to select between the different &rtp; protocols
				and profiles supported by the &rtp; proxy. For example, giving the flag
				<quote>RTP/SAVPF</quote> has the same effect as giving the two flags
				<quote>SRTP AVPF</quote>.
				</para></listitem>
				<listitem><para>
				<emphasis>to-tag</emphasis> - force inclusion of the <quote>To</quote> tag.
				Normally, the <quote>To</quote> tag is always included when present, except
				for <quote>delete</quote> messages. Including the <quote>To</quote> tag in
				a <quote>delete</quote> messages allows you to be more selective about which
				dialogues within a call are being torn down.
				</para></listitem>
				<listitem><para>
				<emphasis>rtcp-mux-demux</emphasis> - if rtcp-mux (RFC 5761) was
				offered, make the &rtp; proxy accept the offer, but not offer it to the
				recipient of this message.
				</para></listitem>
				<listitem><para>
				<emphasis>rtcp-mux-reject</emphasis> - if rtcp-mux was offered, make the
				&rtp; proxy reject the offer, but still offer it to the recipient. Can be
				combined with <quote>rtcp-mux-offer</quote> to always offer it.
				</para></listitem>
				<listitem><para>
				<emphasis>rtcp-mux-offer</emphasis> - make the &rtp; proxy offer rtcp-mux
				to the recipient of this message, regardless of whether it was offered
				originally or not.
				</para></listitem>
				<listitem><para>
				<emphasis>rtcp-mux-accept</emphasis> - if rtcp-mux was offered, make the
				&rtp; proxy accept the offer and also offer it to the recipient of this
				message. Can be combined with <quote>rtcp-mux-offer</quote> to always offer it.
				</para></listitem>
				<listitem><para>
				<emphasis>media-address=...</emphasis> - force a particular media address to
				be used in the &sdp; body. Address family is detected automatically.
