1. Overview

   This is a module that enables media streams to be proxied via an RTP
   proxy. The only RTP proxy currently known to work with this module is
   the Sipwise rtpengine https://github.com/sipwise/rtpengine. The
   rtpengine module is a modified version of the original rtpproxy module
   using a new control protocol. The module is designed to be a drop-in
   replacement for the old module from a configuration file point of view,
   however due to the incompatible control protocol, it only works with
   RTP proxies which specifically support it.

2. Multiple RTP proxy usage

   The rtpengine module can support multiple RTP proxies for
   balancing/distribution and control/selection purposes.

   The module allows definition of several sets of rtpproxies.
   Load-balancing will be performed over a set and the admin has the
   ability to choose what set should be used. The set is selected via its
   id - the id being defined with the set. Refer to the “rtpengine_sock”
   module parameter definition for syntax description.

   The balancing inside a set is done automatically by the module based on
   the weight of each RTP proxy from the set.

   The selection of the set is done from script prior using
   rtpengine_delete(), rtpengine_offer() or rtpengine_answer() functions -
   see the set_rtpengine_set() function.

   Another way to select the set is to define setid_avp module parameter
   and assign setid to the defined avp before calling rtpengine_offer() or
   rtpengine_manage() function. If forwarding of the requests fails and
   there is another branch to try, remember to unset the avp after calling
   rtpengine_delete() function.

   For backward compatibility reasons, a set with no id take by default
   the id 0. Also if no set is explicitly set before rtpengine_delete(),
   rtpengine_offer() or rtpengine_answer() the 0 id set will be used.

   IMPORTANT: if you use multiple sets, take care and use the same set for
   both rtpengine_offer()/rtpengine_answer() and rtpengine_delete()!! If
   the set was selected using setid_avp, the avp needs to be set only once
   before rtpengine_offer() or rtpengine_manage() call.

   Default is empty, the “b” parameter may not be used then.

   Example 1.5. Set extra_id_pv parameter
...
modparam("rtpengine", "extra_id_pv", "$avp(extra_id)")
...

4.6. setid_avp (string)

   The parameter defines an AVP that, if set, determines which RTP proxy
   set rtpengine_offer(), rtpengine_answer(), rtpengine_delete(), and
   rtpengine_manage() functions use.

   There is no default value.

   Example 1.6. Set setid_avp parameter

5.1.  set_rtpengine_set(setid)

   Sets the ID of the RTP proxy set to be used for the next
   rtpengine_delete(), rtpengine_offer(), rtpengine_answer() or
   rtpengine_manage() command. The parameter can be an integer or a config
   variable holding an integer.

   This function can be used from REQUEST_ROUTE, ONREPLY_ROUTE,
   BRANCH_ROUTE.

   Example 1.7. set_rtpengine_set usage
...
set_rtpengine_set("2");
rtpengine_offer();
...

5.2.  rtpengine_offer([flags])

   Rewrites SDP body to ensure that media is passed through an RTP proxy.
   To be invoked on INVITE for the cases the SDPs are in INVITE and 200 OK
   and on 200 OK when SDPs are in 200 OK and ACK.

   Meaning of the parameters is as follows:
     * flags - flags to turn on some features.
       The “flags” string is a list of space-separated items. Each item is
       either an individual token, or a token in “key=value” format. The
       possible tokens are described below.
          + via-branch=... - Include the “branch” value of one of the
            “Via” headers in the request to the RTP proxy. Possible values
            are: “1” - use the first “Via” header; “2” - use the second
            “Via” header; “auto” - use the first “Via” header if this is a
            request, or the second one if this is a reply; “extra” - don't
            take the value from a header, but instead use the value of the
            “extra_id_pv” variable. This can be used to create one media
            session per branch on the RTP proxy. When sending a subsequent
            “delete” command to the RTP proxy, you can then stop just the
            session for a specific branch when passing the flag '1' or '2'
            in the “rtpengine_delete”, or stop all sessions for a call
            when not passing one of those two flags there. This is
            especially useful if you have serially forked call scenarios
            where the RTP proxy gets an “offer” command for a new branch,
            and then a “delete” command for the previous branch, which
            would otherwise delete the full call, breaking the subsequent
            “answer” for the new branch. This flag is only supported by
            the Sipwise rtpengine RTP proxy at the moment!
          + asymmetric - flags that UA from which message is received
            doesn't support symmetric RTP. (automatically sets the 'r'
            flag)
          + force-answer - force “answer”, that is, only rewrite SDP when
            corresponding session already exists in the RTP proxy. By
            default is on when the session is to be completed.
          + internal, external - these flags specify the direction of the
            SIP message. These flags only make sense when the RTP proxy is
            running in bridge mode. “internal” corresponds to the proxy's
            first interface, “external” corresponds to the RTP proxy's
            second interface. You always have to specify two flags to
            define the incoming network and the outgoing network. For
            example, “internal external” should be used for SIP message
            received from the local interface and sent out on the external
            interface, and “external internal” vice versa. Other options
            are “internal internal” and “external external”. So, for
            example if a SIP requests is processed with “internal
            external” flags, the corresponding response must be processed
            with “internal external” flags.
          + auto-bridge - this flag an alternative to the “internal” and
            “external” flags in order to do automatic bridging between
            IPv4 on the "internal network" and IPv6 on the "external
            network". Instead of explicitly instructing the RTP proxy to
            select a particular address family, the distinction is done by
            the given IP in the SDP body by the RTP proxy itself. Not
            supported by Sipwise rtpengine.
          + address-family=... - instructs the RTP proxy that the
            recipient of this SDP body expects to see addresses of a
            particular family. Possible values are “IP4” and “IP6”. For
            example, if the SDP body contains IPv4 addresses but the
            recipient only speaks IPv6, you would use “address-family=IP6”
            to bridge between the two address families.
            Sipwise rtpengine remembers the address family preference of
            each party after it has seen an SDP body from them. This means
            that normally it is only necessary to explicitly specify the
            address family in the “offer”, but not in the “answer”.
            Note: Please note, that this will only work properly with
            non-dual-stack user-agents or with dual-stack clients
            according to RFC6157 (which suggest ICE for Dual-Stack
            implementations). This short-cut will not work properly with
            RFC4091 (ANAT) compatible clients, which suggests having
            different m-lines with different IP-protocols grouped
            together.
          + force - instructs the RTP proxy to ignore marks inserted by
            another RTP proxy in transit to indicate that the session is
            already goes through another proxy. Allows creating a chain of
            proxies. Not supported and ignored by Sipwise rtpengine.
          + trust-address - flags that IP address in SDP should be
            trusted. Without this flag, the RTP proxy ignores address in
            the SDP and uses source address of the SIP message as media
            address which is passed to the RTP proxy.
          + replace-origin - flags that IP from the origin description
            (o=) should be also changed.
          + replace-session-connection - flags to change the session-level
            SDP connection (c=) IP if media description also includes
            connection information.
          + symmetric - flags that for the UA from which message is
            received, support symmetric RTP must be forced.
          + repacketize=NN - requests the RTP proxy to perform
            re-packetization of RTP traffic coming from the UA which has
            sent the current message to increase or decrease payload size
            per each RTP packet forwarded if possible. The NN is the
            target payload size in ms, for the most codecs its value
            should be in 10ms increments, however for some codecs the
            increment could differ (e.g. 30ms for GSM or 20ms for G.723).
            The RTP proxy would select the closest value supported by the
            codec. This feature could be used for significantly reducing
            bandwith overhead for low bitrate codecs, for example with
            G.729 going from 10ms to 100ms saves two thirds of the network
            bandwith. Not supported by Sipwise rtpengine.
          + ICE=... - controls the RTP proxy's behaviour regarding ICE
            attributes within the SDP body. Possible values are: “force” -
            discard any ICE attributes already present in the SDP body and
            then generate and insert new ICE data, leaving itself as the
            only ICE candidates; “remove” instructs the RTP proxy to
            discard any ICE attributes and not insert any new ones into
            the SDP. The default (if no “ICE=...” is given at all), new
            ICE data will only be generated if no ICE was present in the
            SDP originally; otherwise the RTP proxy will only insert
            itself as an additional ICE candidate. Other SDP substitutions
            (c=, m=, etc) are unaffected by this flag.
          + RTP, SRTP, AVP, AVPF - These flags control the RTP transport
            protocol that should be used towards the recipient of the SDP.
            If none of them are specified, the protocol given in the SDP
            is left untouched. Otherwise, the “SRTP” flag indicates that
            SRTP should be used, while “RTP” indicates that SRTP should
            not be used. “AVPF” indicates that the advanced RTCP profile
            with feedback messages should be used, and “AVP” indicates
            that the regular RTCP profile should be used. See also the
            next set of flags below.
          + RTP/AVP, RTP/SAVP, RTP/AVPF, RTP/SAVPF - these serve as an
            alternative, more explicit way to select between the different
            RTP protocols and profiles supported by the RTP proxy. For
            example, giving the flag “RTP/SAVPF” has the same effect as
            giving the two flags “SRTP AVPF”.
          + to-tag - force inclusion of the “To” tag. Normally, the “To”
            tag is always included when present, except for “delete”
            messages. Including the “To” tag in a “delete” messages allows
            you to be more selective about which dialogues within a call
            are being torn down.
          + rtcp-mux-demux - if rtcp-mux (RFC 5761) was offered, make the
            RTP proxy accept the offer, but not offer it to the recipient
            of this message.
          + rtcp-mux-reject - if rtcp-mux was offered, make the RTP proxy
            reject the offer, but still offer it to the recipient. Can be
            combined with “rtcp-mux-offer” to always offer it.
          + rtcp-mux-offer - make the RTP proxy offer rtcp-mux to the
            recipient of this message, regardless of whether it was
            offered originally or not.
          + rtcp-mux-accept - if rtcp-mux was offered, make the RTP proxy
            accept the offer and also offer it to the recipient of this
            message. Can be combined with “rtcp-mux-offer” to always offer
            it.
          + media-address=... - force a particular media address to be
            used in the SDP body. Address family is detected
            automatically.

   This function can be used from ANY_ROUTE.

   Example 1.8. rtpengine_offer usage
route {
...
    if (is_method("INVITE")) {
        if (has_body("application/sdp")) {
            if (rtpengine_offer())
                t_on_reply("1");
        } else {
            t_on_reply("2");
        }
    }
    if (is_method("ACK") && has_body("application/sdp"))
        rtpengine_answer();
...
}

onreply_route[1]
{
...
    if (has_body("application/sdp"))
        rtpengine_answer();
...
}

onreply_route[2]
{
...
    if (has_body("application/sdp"))
        rtpengine_offer();
...
}

5.3.  rtpengine_answer([flags])

   Rewrites SDP body to ensure that media is passed through an RTP proxy.
   To be invoked on 200 OK for the cases the SDPs are in INVITE and 200 OK
   and on ACK when SDPs are in 200 OK and ACK.

   See rtpengine_offer() function description above for the meaning of the
   parameters.

   This function can be used from REQUEST_ROUTE, ONREPLY_ROUTE,
   FAILURE_ROUTE, BRANCH_ROUTE.

   Example 1.9. rtpengine_answer usage

   See rtpengine_offer() function example above for example.

5.4.  rtpengine_delete([flags])

   Tears down the RTPProxy session for the current call.

   See rtpengine_offer() function description above for the meaning of the
   parameters. Note that not all flags make sense for a “delete”.

   This function can be used from ANY_ROUTE.

   Example 1.10. rtpengine_delete usage
...
rtpengine_delete();
...

5.5.  rtpengine_manage([flags])

   Manage the RTPProxy session - it combines the functionality of
   rtpengine_offer(), rtpengine_answer() and rtpengine_delete(), detecting
   internally based on message type and method which one to execute.

   It can take the same parameters as rtpengine_offer(). The flags
   parameter to rtpengine_manage() can be a configuration variable
   containing the flags as a string.

   Functionality:
     * If INVITE with SDP, then do rtpengine_offer()
     * If INVITE with SDP, when the tm module is loaded, mark transaction
       with internal flag FL_SDP_BODY to know that the 1xx and 2xx are for
       rtpengine_answer()
     * If ACK with SDP, then do rtpengine_answer()
     * If BYE or CANCEL, or called within a FAILURE_ROUTE[], then do
       rtpengine_delete()
     * If reply to INVITE with code >= 300 do rtpengine_delete()
     * If reply with SDP to INVITE having code 1xx and 2xx, then do
       rtpengine_answer() if the request had SDP or tm is not loaded,
       otherwise do rtpengine_offer()

   This function can be used from ANY_ROUTE.

   Example 1.11. rtpengine_manage usage
...
rtpengine_manage();
...

5.6.  start_recording()

   This function will send a signal to the RTP proxy to record the RTP
   stream on the RTP proxy. This function is not supported by Sipwise
   rtpengine at the moment!

   This function can be used from REQUEST_ROUTE and ONREPLY_ROUTE.

   Example 1.12. start_recording usage
...
start_recording();
...

6. Exported Pseudo Variables

   6.1. $rtpstat

6.1. $rtpstat

   Returns the RTP statistics from the RTP proxy. The RTP statistics from
   the RTP proxy are provided as a string and it does contain several
   packet counters. The statistics must be retrieved before the session is
   deleted (before rtpengine_delete()).

   2.1.

   How do I migrate from “rtpproxy” or “rtpproxy-ng” to “rtpengine”?

   For the most part, only the names of the functions have changed, with
   “rtpproxy” in each name replaced with “rtpengine”. For example,
   “rtpproxy_manage()” has become “rtpengine_manage()”. A few name
   duplications have also been resolved, for example there is now a single
   “rtpengine_delete()” instead of “unforce_rtp_proxy()” and the identical
   “rtpproxy_destroy()”.

   The largest difference to the old module is how flags are passed to
   “rtpengine_offer()”, “rtpengine_answer()”, “rtpengine_manage()” and
   “rtpengine_delete()”. Instead of having a string of single-letter
   flags, they now take a string of space-separated items, with each item
   being either a single token (word) or a “key=value” pair.

   For example, if you had a call “rtpproxy_offer("FRWOC+PS");”, this
   would then become:
rtpengine_offer("force trust-address symmetric replace-origin replace-session-co
nnection ICE=force RTP/SAVPF");

   Finally, if you were using the second paramater (explicit media
   address) to any of these functions, this has been replaced by the
   “media-address=...” option within the first string of flags.
