1. Overview

   1.1. How ephemeral credentials work

        1.1.1. Request
        1.1.2. Response

   This module contains all authentication related functions that can work
   with ephemeral credentials. This module should be used together with
   the auth module - it cannot be used independently because it depends on
   the auth module. Use this module if you want to use ephemeral
   credentials instead of ordinary usernames and passwords.

1.1. How ephemeral credentials work

   Ephemeral credentials are generated by a web-service and enforced on
   Kamailio. This usage of ephemeral credentials ensures that access to
   Kamailio is controlled even if the credentials cannot be kept secret,
   as can be the case in WebRTC where the credentials may be specified in
   Javascript.

   To use this mechanism, the only interaction needed between the
   web-service and Kamailio is to share a secret key.

   Typically, credentials will be requested from the web-service using an
   HTTP GET and provided in a JSON response. To prevent unauthorised use
   the HTTP requests can be ACLd by various means.

   This mechanism is based on the Google proposal for a "TURN Server REST
   API".

1.1.1. Request

   The request should contain the following parameters:
     * service - specifies the desired service (msrp, sip, etc)
     * username - an optional user identifier for the service
     * ttl - an optional TTL request for the lifetime of the credentials,
       in seconds.

   Example 1.1.
GET /?service=sip&username=foobar;&ttl=86400;

1.1.2. Response

   The response should include the following parameters:
     * username - the username to use with the service, which is a
       combination of the username parameter from the request and a
       timestamp in time_t format, colon-separated. If a username was not
       included in the request this parameter will just include the
       timestamp.
     * password - the password to use; this value is computed from the
       secret key and the returned username value, by performing
       base64(hmac-sha1(secret key, returned username)).
     * ttl - the duration for which the username and password are valid,
       in seconds. This number will be less than or equal to the requested
       TTL.
     * uris - an array of URIs indicating servers that the username and
       password are valid for.

   Example 1.2.
{
  "username" : "foobar:1234567890",
  "password" : "asdfghjklauio=",
  "ttl" : 86400,
  "uris" : [
    "sip:1.2.3.4;transport=ws",
    "sip:5.6.7.8;transport=ws"
  ]
}

2. Dependencies

   2.1. Kamailio Modules
   2.2. External Libraries or Applications

2.1. Kamailio Modules

   The module must be loaded before this module:
     * auth.

2.2. External Libraries or Applications

   The following libraries must be installed before running Kamailio with
   this module loaded:
     * OpenSSL.

3. Parameters

   3.1. secret (string)

3.1. secret (string)

   The shared secret to use for generating credentials. This parameter can
   be set multiple times - this enables the secret used for new
   credentials to be changed without causing existing credentials to stop
   working. The last secret set is the first that will be tried.

   Example 1.3. secret parameter usage
...
modparam("auth_ephemeral", "secret", "kamailio_rules")
...

4. Functions

   4.1. autheph_proxy(realm)
   4.2. autheph_www(realm[, method])
   4.3. autheph_check(realm)

4.1.  autheph_proxy(realm)

   This function performs proxy authentication. the rest.

   The meaning of the parameters are as follows:
     * realm - Realm is an opaque string that the user agent should
       present to the user so that he can decide what username and
       password to use. Usually this is domain of the host the server is
       running on.
       It must not be an empty string “”. Apart from a static string, a
       typical value is the From-URI domain (i.e., $fd).
       The string may contain pseudo variables.

   This function can be used from REQUEST_ROUTE.

   Example 1.4. autheph_proxy usage
...
if (!autheph_proxy("$fd")) {
    auth_challenge("$fd", "1");
    exit;
}
...

4.2.  autheph_www(realm[, method])

   This function performs WWW digest authentication.

   The meaning of the parameters are as follows:
     * realm - Realm is an opaque string that the user agent should
       present to the user so that he can decide what username and
       password to use. Usually this is domain of the host the server is
       running on.
       It must not be an empty string “”. Apart from a static string, a
       typical value is the From-URI domain (i.e., $fd).
       The string may contain pseudo variables.
     * method - the method to be used for authentication. This parameter
       is optional and if not set the first "word" on the request-line is
       used.

   This function can be used from REQUEST_ROUTE.

   Example 1.5. autheph_www usage
...
if (!autheph_www("$fd")) {
    auth_challenge("$fd", "1");
    exit;
}
...

4.3.  autheph_check(realm)

   This function combines the functionalities of autheph_www and
   autheph_proxy, the first being exectuted if the SIP request is a
   REGISTER, the second for the rest.

   The meaning of the parameters are as follows:
     * realm - Realm is an opaque string that the user agent should
       present to the user so that he can decide what username and
       password to use. Usually this is domain of the host the server is
       running on.
       It must not be an empty string “”. Apart from a static string, a
       typical value is the From-URI domain (i.e., $fd).
       The string may contain pseudo variables.

   This function can be used from REQUEST_ROUTE.

   Example 1.6. autheph_check usage
...
if (!autheph_check("$fd")) {
    auth_challenge("$fd", "1");
    exit;
}
...
