1. Overview

   The module does specific handling for notify-subscribe message-summary
   (message waiting indication) events as specified in RFC 3842. It is
   used with the general event handling module, presence. It constructs
   and adds message-summary event to it.

   The module does not currently implement any authorization rules. It
   assumes that publish requests are only issued by a voicemail
   application and subscribe requests only by the owner of voicemail box.
   Authorization can thus be easily done by Kamailio configuration file
   before calling handle_publish() and handle_subscribe() functions.

   The module implements a simple check of content type
   “application/simple-message-summary:” Content must start with
   “Messages-Waiting” status line followed by zero or more lines that
   consist of tabs and printable ASCII characters.
