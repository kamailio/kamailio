1. Overview

   Db_cassandra is one of the SIP Router database modules. It does not
   export any functions executable from the configuration scripts, but it
   exports a subset of functions from the database API, and thus, other
   modules can use it as a database driver, instead of, for example, the
   Mysql module.

   The storage backend is a Cassandra cluster and this module provides an
   SQL interface to be used by other modules for storing and retrieving
   data. Because Cassandra is a NoSQL distributed system, there are
   limitations on the operations that can be performed. The limitations
   concern the indexes on which queries are performed, as it is only
   possible to have simple conditions (equality comparison only) and only
   two indexing levels. These issues will be explained in an example
   below.

   Cassandra DB is especially suited for storing large data or data that
   requires distribution, redundancy or replication. One usage example is
   a distributed location system in a platform that has a cluster of SIP
   Router servers, with more proxies and registration servers accessing
   the same location database. This was actually the main use case we had
   in mind when implementing this module. Please NOTE that it has only
   been tested with the usrloc, auth_db and domain modules.

   You can find a configuration file example for this usage in the module
   - kamailio_cassa.cfg.

   Because the module has to do the translation from SQL to Cassandra
   NoSQL queries, the schemas for the tables must be known by the module.
   You will find the schemas for location, subscriber and version tables
   in utils/kamctl/dbcassandra directory. You have to provide the path to
   the directory containing the table definitions by setting the module
   parameter schema_path.

   There is no need to configure a table metadata in Cassandra cluster.
   You only need to define a keyspace with the name of the database and
   for each table a column family inside that keyspace with the name of
   the table. The comparator and validators should be either UTF8Type or
   ASCIIType. Example:
   ...
   create keyspace openser;
   use openser;
   create column family 'location' with comparator='UTF8Type' and
default_validation_class='UTF8Type' and key_validation_class='UTF8Type';
   ...

   Special attention was given to performance in Cassandra. Therefore, the
   implementation uses only the native row indexing in Cassandra and no
   secondary indexes, because they are costly. Instead, we simulate a
   secondary index by using the column names and putting information in
   them, which is very efficient. Also, for deleting expired records, we
   let Cassandra take care of this with its own mechanism (by setting the
   TTL for columns).

2. Dependencies

   2.1. SIP Router Modules
   2.2. External Libraries or Applications

2.1. SIP Router Modules

   The following modules must be loaded before this module:
     * No dependencies on other SIP Router modules.

2.2. External Libraries or Applications

   The following libraries or applications must be installed before
   running SIP Router with this module loaded:
     * Thrift library version 0.6.1 .

   The implementation was tested with Cassandra version 1.0.1 .

3. Parameters

   3.1. schema_path (string)

3.1. schema_path (string)

   The directory where the files with the table schemas are located. This
   directory has to contain the subdirectories corresponding to the
   databases' names (name of the directory = name of the database). These
   directories, in turn, contain the files with the table schemas. See the
   schemas in utils/kamctl/dbcassandra directory.

   Example 1.1. Set schema_path parameter
   ...
   modparam("db_cassandra", "schema_path",
               "/usr/local/sip-router/etc/kamctl/dbcassandra")
   ...

4. Functions

   NONE

5. Installation

   Because it dependes on an external library, the db_cassandra module is
   not compiled and installed by default. You can use one of these
   options:
     * - edit the "Makefile" and remove "db_cassandra" from
       "excluded_modules" list. Then follow the standard procedure to
       install SIP Router: "make all; make install".
     * - from command line, run: 'make all include_modules="db_cassandra";
       make install include_modules="db_cassandra"'.

6. Table schema

   The module must know the table schema for the tables that will be used.
   You must configure the path to the schema directory by setting the
   schema_path parameter.

   A table schema document has the following structure:
     * First row: the name and type of the columns in the form name(type)
       separated by spaces. The possible types are: string, int, double
       and timestamp.
       Thetimestamp type has a special meaning. Only one column of this
       type can be defined for a table, and it should contain the expiry
       time for that record. If defined this value will be used to compute
       the ttl for the columns and Cassandra will automatically delete the
       columns when they expire. Because we want the ttl to have meaning
       for the entire record, we must ensure that when the ttl is updated,
       it is updated for all columns for that record. In other words, to
       update the expiration time of a record, an insert operation must be
       performed from the point of view of the db_cassandra module
       ("insert" in Cassandra means "replace if exists or insert new
       record otherwise"). So, if you define a table with a timestamp
       column, the update operations on that table that also update the
       timestamp must update all columns. So, these update operations must
       in fact be insert operations.
     * Second row: the columns that form the row key separated by space.
     * Third row: the columns that form the secondary key separated by
       space.

   Bellow you can see the schema for the location table:

   ...
   callid(string) cflags(int) contact(string) cseq(int) expires(timestamp) flags
(int) last_modified(int) methods(int) path(string) q(double) received(string) so
cket(string) user_agent(string) username(string)
   username
   contact
   ...

   Observe first that the row key is the username and the secondary index
   is the contact. We have also defined a timestamp column - expires. In
   this example, both the row key and the secondary index are defined by
   only one column, but they can be formed out of more columns. You can
   list them separated by space.

   To understand why the schema looks like this, we must first see which
   queries are performed on the location table. (The 'callid' condition
   was ignored as it doesn't really have a well defined role in the SIP
   RFC).
     * When Invite received, lookup location: select where username='..'.
     * When Register received, update registration: update where
       username='..' and contact='..'.

   So, the relation between these keys is the following:
     * The unique key for a table is actually the combination of row key +
       secondary key.
     * A row defined by a row key will contain more records with different
       secondary keys.

   The timestamp column that leaves the Cassandra cluster to deal with
   deleting expired record can be used only with a modification to the
   usrloc module that replaces the update performed at re-registration
   with an insert operation (so that all columns are updated). This
   behavior can be enabled by setting a parameter in the usrloc module
   db_update_as_insert:

   ...
   modparam("usrloc", "db_update_as_insert", 1)
   ...

   The alternative would have been to define an index on the expire column
   and run a external job to periodically delete the expired records.
   However, obviously, this would be more costly.

7. Limitations

   The module can be used only when the queries use only one index, which
   is also the unique key, or have two indexes that form the unique key
   like in the usrloc usage.
