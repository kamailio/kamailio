	    Named branch failure routes can be defined to run when when a failure response is received.
            This allows handling failures on individual branches, for example, retrying an alternative outbound flow.

        <para>
	    The format of the event_route name is "tm:branch-failure:&lt;name&gt;" and is enabled with the t_on_branch_failure function.
            This event_route uses the BRANCH_FAILURE_ROUTE route type.
