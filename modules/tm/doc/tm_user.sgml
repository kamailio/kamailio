	<title>Overview</title>
	<para>
	    <acronym>TM</acronym> module enables stateful processing of &sip; transactions. The main
	    use of stateful logic, which is costly in terms of memory and <acronym>CPU</acronym>, is
	    some services inherently need state. For example, transaction-based accounting (module
	    acc) needs to process transaction state as opposed to individual messages, and any kinds
	    of forking must be implemented statefully. Other use of stateful processing is it trading
	    <acronym>CPU</acronym> caused by retransmission processing for memory. That makes
	    however only sense if <acronym>CPU</acronym> consumption per request is huge. For
	    example, if you want to avoid costly <acronym>DNS</acronym> resolution for every
	    retransmission of a request to an unresolvable destination, use stateful mode. Then,
	    only the initial message burdens server by <acronym>DNS</acronym> queries, subsequent
	    retransmissions will be dropped and will not result in more processes blocked by
	    <acronym>DNS</acronym> resolution. The price is more memory consumption and higher
	    processing latency.
	</para>
	<para>
	    From user's perspective, there are these major functions : t_relay, t_relay_to_udp
		and t_relay_to_tcp. All of them
	    setup transaction state, absorb retransmissions from upstream, generate downstream
	    retransmissions and correlate replies to requests. t_relay forwards to current &uri; (be
	    it original request's &uri; or a &uri; changed by some of &uri;-modifying functions,
	    such as sethost). t_relay_to_udp and t_relay_to_tcp forward to a specific address
		over UDP or TCP respectively.
	</para>
	<para>
	    In general, if <acronym>TM</acronym> is used, it copies clones of received &sip;
	    messages in shared memory. That costs the memory and also <acronym>CPU</acronym> time
	    (memcpys, lookups, shmem locks, etc.)  Note that non-<acronym>TM</acronym> functions
	    operate over the received message in private memory, that means that any core operations
	    will have no effect on statefully processed messages after creating the transactional
	    state. For example, calling record_route <emphasis>after</emphasis> t_relay is pretty
	    useless, as the <acronym>RR</acronym> is added to privately held message whereas its
	    <acronym>TM</acronym> clone is being forwarded.
	</para>
	<para>
	    <acronym>TM</acronym> is quite big and uneasy to program--lot of mutexes, shared memory
	    access, malloc & free, timers--you really need to be careful when you do anything. To
	    simplify <acronym>TM</acronym> programming, there is the instrument of callbacks. The
	    callback mechanisms allow programmers to register their functions to specific event. See
	    t_hooks.h for a list of possible events.
	</para>
	<para>
	    Other things programmers may want to know is &uac;--it is a very simplistic code which
	    allows you to generate your own transactions. Particularly useful for things like
	    NOTIFYs or <acronym>IM</acronym> gateways. The &uac; takes care of all the transaction
	    machinery: retransmissions , FR timeouts, forking, etc.  See t_uac prototype in uac.h
	    for more details. Who wants to see the transaction result may register for a callback.

	    <title>External Usage of <acronym>TM</acronym></title>

	    <para>
		There are applications which would like to generate &sip; transactions without too
		big involvement in &sip; stack, transaction management, etc. An example of such an
		application is sending instant messages from a website. To address needs of such
		apps, &ser; accepts requests for new transactions via fifo pipes too. If you want to
		enable this feature, start <acronym>FIFO</acronym> server with configuration option.
	    </para>
	    <para>
		fifo=<quote>/tmp/ser_fifo</quote>
	    </para>
	    <para>
		Then, an application can easily launch a new transaction by writing a transaction
		request to this named pipe. The request must follow very simple format, which is
	    </para>
	    <programlisting format="linespecific">
 :t_uac_from:[&lt;file_name&gt;]\n
 &lt;method&gt;\n
 &lt;sender's uri&gt;\n
 &lt;dst uri&gt;\n
 &lt;CR_separated_headers&gt;\n
 &lt;body&gt;\n
 .\n
 \n
</programlisting>
	    <para>
		(Filename is to where a report will be dumped. ser assumes /tmp
		as file's directory.)
	    </para>
	    <para>
		Note the the request write must be atomic, otherwise it might get intermixed with
		writes from other writers. You can easily use it via Unix command-line tools, see
		the following example:
	    </para>
	    <screen format="linespecific">
[jiri@bat jiri]$ cat &gt; /tmp/ser_fifo

			Possibly, performance could be improved by not parsing non-INVITEs, as they
			do not be replied with 100, and do not result in ACK/CANCELs, and other
			things which take parsing. However, we need to rethink whether we don't need
			parsed headers later for something else. Remember, when we now conserver a
			request in sh_mem, we can't apply any pkg_mem operations to it any
			more. (that might be redesigned too).
