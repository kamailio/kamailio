    <title>Parameters</title>

    <section id="fr_timer">
	<title><varname>fr_timer</varname> (integer)</title>
	<para>
	    Timer which hits if no final reply for a request or ACK for a
	    negative INVITE reply arrives (in milliseconds).
	</para>
	<para>
	    Default value is 30 seconds.
	</para>

	    <title>Set <varname>fr_timer</varname> parameter</title>

    <section id="fr_inv_timer">
	<title><varname>fr_inv_timer</varname> (integer)</title>
	<para>
	    Timer which hits if no final reply for an INVITE arrives after a
	    provisional message was received (in milliseconds).
	</para>
	<para>
	    Default value is 120 seconds.
	</para>

    <section id="wt_timer">
	<title><varname>wt_timer</varname> (integer)</title>
	<para>
	    Time for which a transaction stays in memory to absorb delayed
	    messages after it completed; also, when this timer hits,
	    retransmission of local cancels is stopped (a puristic but complex
	    behavior would be not to enter wait state until local branches are
	    finished by a final reply or FR timer--we simplified).
	</para>
	<para>
	    Default value is 5 seconds.
	</para>
	<example>
	    <title>Set <varname>wt_timer</varname> parameter</title>

    <section id="delete_timer">
	<title><varname>delete_timer</varname> (integer)</title>
	<para>
	    Time after which a to-be-deleted transaction currently ref-ed by a
	    process will be tried to be deleted again.
	</para>
	<para>
	    Default value is 200 milliseconds.
	</para>

    <section id="retr_timer1">
	<title><varname>retr_timer1</varname> (integer)</title>
	<para>
	    Initial retransmission period (in milliseconds).
	</para>
	<para>
	    Default value is 500 milliseconds.

    <section id="retr_timer2">
	<title><varname>retr_timer2</varname> (integer)</title>
	<para>
	    Maximum retransmission period (in milliseconds). The retransmission
		interval starts with <varname>retr_timer1</varname> and increases until
		it reaches this value. After this it stays constant at 
		<varname>retr_timer2</varname>.
	</para>
	<para>
	    Default value is 4000 milliseconds.

    <section id="noisy_ctimer">
	<title><varname>noisy_ctimer</varname> (integer)</title>
	<para>
	    If set, INVITE transactions that time-out (FR INV timer) will be 
		always replied. If it's not set, the transaction has only one
		branch and no response was ever received on this branch, it 
		will be silently dropped (no 408 reply will be generated)
		This behavior is overridden if a request is forked, the transaction
		 has a failure route or callback, or some functionality explicitly 
		 turned it on  for a transaction (like acc does to avoid unaccounted
		 transactions due to expired timer).
		Turn this off only if you know the client UACs will timeout and their
		timeout interval fro INVITEs is lower or equal than tm's
		<varname>fr_inv_timer</varname>.
	</para>
	<para>
	    Default value is 1 (on).
	</para>
	<example>
	    <title>Set <varname>noisy_ctimer</varname> parameter</title>

	<section id="unix_tx_timeout">
	<title><varname>unix_tx_timeout</varname> (integer)</title>
	<para>
		Unix socket transmission timeout, in milliseconds.
	</para>
	<para>
		If unix sockets are used (e.g.: to communicate with sems) and sending
		a message on a unix socket takes longer then 
		<varname>unix_tx_timeout</varname>, the send will fail.
	</para>
	<para>
	    The default value is 500 milliseconds.
	</para>
	<example>
	    <title>Set <varname>unix_tx_timeout</varname> parameter</title>
	    <programlisting>
...
modparam("tm", "unix_tx_timeout", 250)

	</example>
	</section>

    <section id="aggregate_challenges">
	<title><varname>aggregate_challenges</varname> (integer)</title>
	<para>
		If set (default), the final reply is a 401 or a 407 and more then
		one branch received a 401 or 407, then all the WWW-Authenticate and 
		Proxy-Authenticate headers from all the 401 and 407 replies will 
		be aggregated in a new final reply. If only one branch received the
		 winning 401 or 407 then this reply will be forwarded (no new one
		 will be built).
		If 0 only the first 401, or if no 401 was received the first 407,  will
		be forwarded (no header aggregation).
	</para>
	<para>
	    Default value is 1 (required by rfc3261).
	</para>
	<example>
	    <title>Set <varname>aggregate_challenges</varname> parameter</title>
	    <programlisting>

    <section id="reparse_invite">
	<title><varname>reparse_invite</varname> (integer)</title>
	<para>
		If set (default), the CANCEL and negative ACK requests are
		constructed from the INVITE message which was sent out instead
		of building them from the received request. The disadvantage is
		that the outgoing INVITE has to be partially re-parsed, the advantage
		is that the CANCEL/ACK is always RFC 3261-compliant, it always
		contains the same route-set as the INVITE message. Do not disable
		the INVITE re-parsing for example in the following cases:
	</para>
	<para>
		- The INVITE contains a preloaded route-set, and SER forwards
		the message to the next hop according to the Route header. The
		Route header is not removed in the CANCEL without
		<varname>reparse_invite</varname>=1.
	</para>
	<para>
		- SER record-routes, thus an in-dialog INVITE contains a Route
		header which is removed during loose routing. If the in-dialog
		INVITE is rejected, the negative ACK still contains the Route
		header without <varname>reparse_invite</varname>=1.
	</para>
	<para>
	    Default value is 1.
	</para>
	<example>
	    <title>Set <varname>reparse_invite</varname> parameter</title>
	    <programlisting>
...
modparam("tm", "reparse_invite", 0)
...
	    </programlisting>
	</example>
    </section>

    <section id="ac_extra_hdrs">
	<title><varname>ac_extra_hdrs</varname> (string)</title>
	<para>
		Header fields prefixed by this parameter value are included
		in the CANCEL and negative ACK messages if they were present
		in the outgoing INVITE.
	</para>
	<para>
		Note, that the parameter value effects only those headers
		which are not covered by RFC-3261 (which are neither mandatory
		nor prohibited in CANCEL and ACK), and the parameter can be used
		only together with <varname>reparse_invite</varname>=1.
	</para>
	<para>
	    Default value is "".
	</para>
	<example>
	    <title>Set <varname>ac_extra_hdrs</varname> parameter</title>
	    <programlisting>
...
modparam("tm", "ac_extra_hdrs", "myfavoriteheaders-")
