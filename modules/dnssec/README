        3.1. general_query_flags (integer)

1. Overview

   The module replaces the common system dns resolver functions from core
   with the DNSSEC wrappers provided by libval. Practically, by loading
   the module, Kamailio will make use of extensions to DNS which provide
   origin authentication of DNS data, authenticated denial of existence,
   and data integrity.

   There is no module parameter that should be set nor fuction that has to
   be executed by the configuration file. Existing SIP server deployments
   can be updated to use DNSSEC by loading this module and setting
   appropriate DNS server to the operating system.

   Installing libval can be done from https://www.dnssec-tools.org.

   More details about DNSSEC are available at:
   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System_Security_Extensions.

2. Dependencies

   2.1. Kamailio Modules
   2.2. External Libraries or Applications

2.1. Kamailio Modules

   The following modules must be loaded before this module:
     * No dependencies on other Kamailio modules.

2.2. External Libraries or Applications

   The following libraries or applications must be installed before
   running Kamailio with this module loaded:
     * libval - check https://www.dnssec-tools.org for installation
       guidelines.

3. Parameters

   3.1. general_query_flags (integer)

3.1. general_query_flags (integer)

   Set this parameter to an integer value containing of an ORed result of
   one or more of the following values (constant present only for
   documentation process, as they are mostly mapped to libval
   flags).Setting this parameter will cause the libval defaults to be
   completely overwritten

   QUERY_DONT_VALIDATE == 1<<0 causes the validator to disable validation
   for this query.

   QUERY_IGNORE_SKEW == 1<<1 causes the validator to disable checking
   signature inception and expiration times on RRSIGs.

   QUERY_AC_DETAIL == 1<<2 causes the validator to copy the authentication
   chain details into the val_rc_answer member within the returned
   val_result_chain structure.

   QUERY_NO_DLV == 1<<3 causes the validator to disable DLV processing for
   this query. This is only available if the libval(3) library has been
   compiled with DLV support.

   QUERY_NO_EDNS0_FALLBACK = 1<<4 In querying various name servers,
   libsres will also attempt multiple EDNS0 sizes, ending with a query
   that has EDNS0 disabled (i.e. no CD bit set). This option causes libval
   to disable EDNS0 fallback for the query.

   QUERY_RECURSE == 1<<5 forces libval to recursively answer the query by
   iteratively querying various name servers in the delegation hierarchy,
   instead of requesting this information from any caching name server
   that may be configured in dnsval.conf

   SKIP_RESOLVER == 1<<6 forces libval to only look at its cache while
   trying to resolve a name.

   SKIP_CACHE == 1<<7 forces libval to ignore cached data while trying to
   resolve a name.

   Default value is 0(no changes)

   Example 1.1. Set enable_full_lr parameter
 ...
 modparam("dnssec", "general_query_flags", 1) # QUERY_DONT_VALIDATE disable vali
dation
 modparam("dnssec", "general_query_flags", 10) # QUERY_IGNORE_SKEW | QUERY_NO_DLV
 ...
