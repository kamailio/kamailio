   6. Functions

        6.1. call_control()

1. Overview

   This module allows one to limit the duration of calls and automatically
   end them when they exceed the imposed limit. Its main use case is to
   implement a prepaid system, but it can also be used to impose a global
   limit on all calls processed by the proxy.

2. Description

   Callcontrol consists of 3 components:
     * The Kamailio call_control module
     * An external application called callcontrol which keeps track of the
       calls that have a time limit and automatically ends them when they
       exceed it. This application receives requests from Kamailio and
       makes requests to a rating engine (see below) to find out if a call
       needs to be limited or not. When a call ends (or is ended) it will
       also instruct the rating engine to debit the balance for the caller
       with the consumed amount. The callcontrol application is available
       from http://callcontrol.ag-projects.com/
     * A rating engine that is used to calculate the time limit based on
       the caller's credit and the destination price and to debit the
       caller's balance after a call ends. This is available as part of
       CDRTool from http://cdrtool.ag-projects.com/

   The callcontrol application runs on the same machine as Kamailio and
   they communicate over a filesystem socket, while the rating engine can
   run on a different host and communicates with the callcontrol
   application using a TCP connection.

   Callcontrol is invoked by calling the call_control() function for the
   initial INVITE of every call we want to apply a limit to. This will end
   up as a request to the callcontrol application, which will interogate
   the rating engine for a time limit for the given caller and
   destination. The rating engine will determine if the destination has
   any associated cost and if the caller has any credit limit and if so
   will return the amount of time he is allowed to call that destination.
   Otherwise it will indicate that there is no limit associated with the
   call. If there is a limit, the callcontrol application will retain the
   session and attach a timer to it that will expire after the given time
   causing it to call back to Kamailio with a request to end the dialog.
   If the rating engine returns that there is no limit for the call, the
   session is discarded by the callcontrol application and it will allow
   it to go proceed any limit. An appropriate response is returned to the
   call_control module that is then returned by the call_control()
   function call and allows the script to make a decision based on the
   answer.

3. Features

     * Very simple API consisting of a single function that needs to be
       called once for the first INVITE of every call. The rest is done
       automatically in the background using dialog callbacks.
     * Gracefully end dialogs when they exceed their time by triggering a
       dlg_end_dlg request into the dialog module, that will generate two
       BYE messages towards each endpoint, ending the call cleanly.
     * Allow parallel sessions using one balance per subscriber
     * Integrates with mediaproxy's ability to detect when a call does
       timeout sending media and is closed. In this case the dlg_end_dlg
       that is triggered by mediaproxy will end the callcontrol session
       before it reaches the limit and consumes all the credit for a call
       that died and didn't actually take place. For this mediaproxy has
       to be used and it has to be started by engage_media_proxy() to be
       able to keep track of the call's dialog and end it on timeout.
       Even when mediaproxy is unable to end the dialog because it was not
       started with engage_media_proxy(), the callcantrol application is
       still able to detect calls that did timeout sending media, by
       looking in the radius accounting records for entries recorded by
       mediaproxy for calls that did timeout. These calls will also be
       ended gracefully by the callcontrol application itself.

5. Exported parameters

   5.1. disable (int)
   5.2. socket_name (string)
   5.3. socket_timeout (int)
   5.4. signaling_ip_avp (string)
   5.5. canonical_uri_avp (string)
   5.6. diverter_avp_id (string)

5.1. disable (int)

   Boolean flag that specifies if callcontrol should be disabled. This is
   useful when you want to use the same Kamailio configuration in two
   different contexts, one using callcontrol, the other not. In the case
   callcontrol is disabled, calls to the call_control() function will
   return a code indicating that there is no limit associated with the
   call, allowing the use of the same configuration without changes.

   Default value is "0".

   Example 1.1. Setting the disable parameter
...
modparam("call_control", "disable", 1)
...

5.2. socket_name (string)

   The path to the filesystem socket where the callcontrol application
   listens for commands from the module.

   Default value is "/var/run/callcontrol/socket".

   Example 1.2. Setting the socket_name parameter
...
modparam("call_control", "socket_name", "/var/run/callcontrol/socket")
...

5.3. socket_timeout (int)

   How long time (in milliseconds) to wait for an answer from the
   callcontrol application.

   Default value is "500" ms.

   Example 1.3. Setting the socket_timeout parameter
...
modparam("call_control", "socket_timeout", 500)
...

5.4. signaling_ip_avp (string)

   Specification of the AVP which holds the IP address from where the SIP
   signaling originated. If this AVP is set it will be used to get the
   signaling IP address, else the source IP address from where the SIP
   message was received will be used. This AVP is meant to be used in
   cases where there are more than one proxy in the call setup path and
   the proxy that actually starts callcontrol doesn't receive the SIP
   messages directly from the UA and it cannot determine the NAT IP
   address from where the signaling originated. In such a case attaching a
   SIP header at the first proxy and then copying that header's value into
   the signaling_ip_avp on the proxy that starts callcontrol will allow it
   to get the correct NAT IP address from where the SIP signaling
   originated.

   This is used by the rating engine which finds the rates to apply to a
   call based on caller's SIP URI, caller's SIP domain or caller's IP
   address (whichever yields a rate forst, in this order).

   Default value is "$avp(s:signaling_ip)".

   Example 1.4. Setting the signaling_ip_avp parameter
...
modparam("call_control", "signaling_ip_avp", "$avp(s:signaling_ip)")
...

5.5. canonical_uri_avp (string)

   Specification of the AVP which holds an optional application defined
   canonical request URI. When this is set, it will be used as the
   destination when computing the call price, otherwise the request URI
   will be used. This is useful when the username of the ruri needs to
   have a different, canonical form in the rating engine computation than
   it has in the ruri.

   Default value is "$avp(s:can_uri)".

   Example 1.5. Setting the canonical_uri_avp parameter
...
modparam("call_control", "canonical_uri_avp", "$avp(s:can_uri)")
...

5.6. diverter_avp_id (string)

   Specification of the id of an integer AVP which holds an optional
   application defined diverter SIP URI. When this is set, it will be used
   by the rating engine as the billing party when finding the rates to
   apply to a given call, otherwise, the caller's URI taken from the From
   field will be used. When set, this AVP should contain a value in the
   form "user@domain" (no sip: prefix should be used).

   This is useful when a destination diverts a call, thus becoming the new
   caller. In this case the billing party is the diverter and this AVP
   should be set to it, to allow the rating engine to pick the right rates
   for the call. For example, if A calls B and B diverts all its calls
   unconditionally to C, then the diverter AVP should the set to B's URI,
   because B is the billing party in the call not A after the call was
   diverted.

   Default value is "805".

   Example 1.6. Setting the diverter_avp_id parameter
...
modparam("call_control", "diverter_avp_id", 805)

route {
  ...
  # alice@example.com is paying for this call
  $avp(i:805) = "sip:alice@example.com";
  ...
}
...

6. Functions

   6.1. call_control()

6.1. call_control()

   Trigger the use of callcontrol for the dialog started by the INVITE for
   which this function is called (the function should only be called for
   the first INVITE of a call). Further in-dialog requests will be
   processed automatically using internal bindings into the dialog state
   machine, allowing callcontrol to update its internal state as the
   dialog progresses, without any other intervention from the script.

   This function should be called right before the message is sent out
   using t_relay(), when all the request uri modifications are over and a
   final destination has been determined.

   This function has the following return codes:

     * +2 - call has no limit
     * +1 - call has limit and is traced by callcontrol
     * -1 - not enough credit to make the call
     * -2 - call is locked by another call in progress
     * -5 - internal error (message parsing, communication, ...)

   This function can be used from REQUEST_ROUTE.

   Example 1.7. Using the call_control function
...
if (is_avp_set("$avp(i:805)")) {
    # the diverter AVP is set, use it as billing party
    $avp(s:billing_party_domain) = $(avp(i:805){uri.domain});
} else {
    $avp(s:billing_party_domain) = $fd;
}

if (method==INVITE && !has_totag() &&
    is_domain_local("$avp(s:billing_party_domain)")) {
    call_control();
    switch ($retcode) {
    case 2:
        # Call with no limit
    case 1:
        # Call has limit and is under callcontrol management
        break;
    case -1:
        # Not enough credit (prepaid call)
        sl_send_reply("402", "Not enough credit");
        exit;
        break;
    case -2:
        # Locked by another call in progress (prepaid call)
        sl_send_reply("403", "Call locked by another call in progress");
        exit;
        break;
    default:
        # Internal error (message parsing, communication, ...)
        if (PREPAID_ACCOUNT) {
            xlog("Call control: internal server error\n");
            sl_send_reply("500", "Internal server error");
            exit;
        } else {
            xlog("L_WARN", "Cannot set time limit for postpaid call\n");
        }
    }
}
t_relay();
...
