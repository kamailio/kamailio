1. Overview

   The exec module allows external commands to be executed from a Kamailio
   script. The commands may be any valid shell commands--the command
   string is passed to the shell using "popen" command. Kamailio passes
   additional information about the request in environment variables:
     * SIP_HF_<hf_name> contains value of each header field in request. If
       a header field occurred multiple times, values are concatenated and
       comma-separated. <hf_name> is in capital letters. Ff a header-field
       name occurred in compact form, <hf_name> is canonical.
     * SIP_TID is transaction identifier. All request retransmissions or
       CANCELs/ACKs associated with a previous INVITE result in the same
       value.
     * SIP_DID is dialog identifier, which is the same as to-tag.
       Initially, it is empty.
     * SIP_SRCIP is source IP address from which request came.
     * SIP_ORURI is the original request URI.
     * SIP_RURI is current request URI (if unchanged, equal to original).
     * SIP_USER is userpart of current request URI.
     * SIP_OUSER is userpart of original request URI.

   NOTE: The environment variables must be specified with double $ (e.g.,
   $$SIP_OUSER) in the parameters given to exec functions. Otherwise they
   will be evaluated as Kamailio pseudo-variables, throwing errors.

2. Dependencies

   2.1. Kamailio Modules
   2.2. External Libraries or Applications

2.1. Kamailio Modules

   The following modules must be loaded before this module:
     * No dependencies on other Kamailio modules.

2.2. External Libraries or Applications

   The following libraries or applications must be installed before
   running Kamailio with this module loaded:
     * None.

3. Parameters

   3.1. setvars (integer)
   3.2. time_to_kill (integer)

3.1. setvars (integer)

   Turn off to disable setting environment variables for executed
   commands.

   Default value is 1.

   Example 1.1. Set "setvars" parameter
...
modparam("exec", "setvars", 1)
...

3.2. time_to_kill (integer)

   Specifies the longest time a program is allowed to execute. If the time
   is exceeded, the program is killed.

   Default value is 0.

   Example 1.2. Set "time_to_kill" parameter
...
modparam("exec", "time_to_kill", 20)
...

4. Functions

   4.1. exec_dset(command)
   4.2. exec_msg(command)
   4.3. exec_avp(command [, avplist])

4.1. exec_dset(command)

   Executes an external command. Current URI is passed to the command as
   parameter. Output of the command is considered URI set (separated by
   lines).

   Meaning of the parameters is as follows:
     * command - Command to be executed. It can include pseudo- variabes;

   WARNING: if the var you are passing out has a bash special character in
   it, the var needs to be placed inside quotes, for example:
   exec_dset("print-contact.sh '$ct'");

   This function can be used from REQUEST_ROUTE, FAILURE_ROUTE.

   Example 1.3. exec_dset usage
...
exec_dset("echo TEST > /tmp/test.txt");
exec_dset("echo TEST > /tmp/$rU.txt");
...

4.2. exec_msg(command)

   Executes an external command. The whole message is passed to it in
   input, no command-line parameters are added, output of the command is
   not processed.

   The "examples" directory in the source tarball contains several
   examples that shows how to use this function.

   Meaning of the parameters is as follows:
     * command - Command to be executed. It can include pseudo-variables.

   WARNING: if the var you are passing out has a bash special character in
   it, the var needs to be placed inside quotes, for example:
   exec_msg("print-contact.sh '$ct'");

   This function can be used from REQUEST_ROUTE, FAILURE_ROUTE.

   Example 1.4. exec_msg usage
...
exec_msg("echo TEST > /tmp/test.txt");
exec_msg("echo TEST > /tmp/$rU.txt");
...

4.3. exec_avp(command [, avplist])

   Executes an external command. Each line from output of the command is
   saved in an AVP from 'avplist'. If 'avplist' is missing, the AVPs are
   named 1, 2, 3, ...

   Meaning of the parameters is as follows:
     * command - Command to be executed. It can include pseudo- variabes;
     * avplist - comma separated list with AVP names to store the result
       in;

   WARNING: if the var you are passing out has a bash special character in
   it, the var needs to be placed inside quotes, for example:
   exec_avp("print-contact.sh '$ct'");

   This function can be used from REQUEST_ROUTE, FAILURE_ROUTE.

   Example 1.5. exec_avp usage
...
exec_avp("echo TEST");
exec_avp("echo TEST", "$avp(s:test)");
...

5. Known Issues

   There is currently no guarantee that scripts ever return and stop
   blocking the SIP server. (There is kill.c but it is not used along with
   the current mechanisms based on popen. Besides that kill.c is ugly).
