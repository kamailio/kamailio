	<title>History</title>
		<para>
			This module was put together by Jan Janak <email>jan@iptel.org</email> from code 
			based on the experimental tls core addon (<ulink url="http://cvs.berlios.de/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/ser/experimental/tls/">http://cvs.berlios.de/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/ser/experimental/tls/</ulink>), 
			code originally written by Peter Griffiths and later maintained by Cesc Santasusana and 
			from an iptelorg tls code addon, written by Andrei Pelinescu-Onciul <email>andrei@iptel.org</email>.
			Jan also added support for multiple domains, a tls specific config, config reloading and a 
			tls specific select framework.
		</para>
		<para>
			For &kamailio; 3.1 most of the TLS specific code was completely
			re-written to add support for asynchronous TLS and fix several
			long standing bugs.
		</para>
		<para>
			The code is currently maintained by Andrei Pelinescu-Onciul <email>andrei@iptel.org</email>.
