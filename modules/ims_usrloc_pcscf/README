1. Overview

   This module serves as a storage engine for PCSCF contacts, much like
   the standard Kamailio module, usrloc, is a storage engine for standard
   SIP contacts. The concept of a contact in IMS, PCSCF specifically, is
   very different to that of std. SIP and as a result we have built this
   new module. Alot of the design has been borrowed from the std. usrloc
   module. For example. An IMS contact, in PCSCF, needs things like:
     * Diameter Rx session for signalling bearer status. i.e. this is
       effectively QoS from the network to make sure the signalling link
       can be 'trusted'
     * IPSEC Security Assocation for secure signalling between UE and
       PCSCF (first point of contact)
     * IMPU, each contact can have a number of associated public
       identities (IMPU).

2. Dependencies

   2.1. Kamailio Modules
   2.2. External Libraries or Applications

2.1. Kamailio Modules

   The following modules must be loaded before this module:
     * None.

2.2. External Libraries or Applications

   The following libraries or applications must be installed before
   running Kamailio with this module loaded:
     * None.

3. Parameters

   3.1. hash_size (int)
   3.2. timer_interval (int)

3.1. hash_size (int)

   The number of entries of the hash table used by to store the contact
   records is 2^hash_size. For hash_size=4, the number of entries of the
   hash table is 16.

   Default value is 9.

   Example 1.1. Set hash_size parameter
...
modparam("ims_usrloc_pcscf", "hash_size", 10)
...

3.2. timer_interval (int)

   Number of seconds between two timer runs. The module uses timer to
   delete expired contacts.

   Default value is 60.

   Example 1.2. Set timer_interval parameter
...
modparam("ims_usrloc_pcscf", "timer_interval", 30)
...

4. Functions

   4.1.

   There are no exported functions that could be used in scripts.

5. RPC Commands

   5.1. ulpcscf.status

   exported RPC commands.

5.1. ulpcscf.status

   Status of pcscf_usrloc, AORs, max slots, etc.

6. Statistics

   6.1. registered contacts
   6.2. impus
   6.3. expired contacts

   Exported statistics are listed in the next sections.

6.1. registered contacts

   Number of AOR contacts in registered state - cannot be reset.

6.2. impus

   Number of IMPUs - cannot be reset.

6.3. expired contacts

   Number of expired contacts - can be reset.
