1. Overview

   This module provides basic HTTP/1.0 server functionality inside
   Kamailio. SIP and HTTP are very similar protocols, so, practically, the
   SIP parser can easily handle HTTP requests just by adding a fake Via
   header.

   The <module>xmlrpc</module> module uses the same concept. The xHTTP
   module offers a generic way of handling the HTTP protocol, by calling
   event_route[xhttp:request] in your config. You can check the HTTP URL
   via the config variable $hu. Note that use of $ru will raise errors
   since the structure of an HTTP URL is not compatible with that of a SIP
   URI.

2. Note on Latency

   Because HTTP requests in xhttp are handled by the same, finite number
   of SIP worker processes that operate on SIP messages, the same general
   principles regarding script execution speed and throughput should be
   observed by the writer in event_route[xhttp:request] as in any other
   part of the route script.

   For example, if you initiate a database query in the HTTP request route
   that takes a long time to return rows, the SIP worker process in which
   the request is handled will be blocked for that time and unable to
   process other SIP messages. In most typical installations, there are
   only a few of these worker processes running.

   Therefore, it is highly inadvisable to execute particularly slow things
   in the event_route[xhttp:request], because the request is not handled
   in an asynchronous manner or otherwise peripherally to general SIP
   processing. SIP worker threads will block, pending the outcome of the
   event route just like any other config script route.

   This is no more or less true for xhttp than it is for any other block
   of script in any other scenario, and does not warrant any extraordinary
   concern. It nevertheless bears mention here because some processes with
   embedded HTTP servers have the request processing take place "outside"
   of the main synchronous event sequence, whether by creating separate
   threads or by some other asynchronous handling. That is not the case
   with xhttp.

3. Dependencies

   3.1. Kamailio Modules
   3.2. Kamailio Core Settings
   3.3. External Libraries or Applications

3.1. Kamailio Modules

   The following modules must be loaded before this module:
     * sl - stateless reply.

3.2. Kamailio Core Settings

   SIP requires a Content-Length header for TCP transport. But most HTTP
   clients do not set the content length for normal GET requests.
   Therefore, the core must be configured to allow incoming requests
   without content length header:
     * tcp_accept_no_cl=yes

3.3. External Libraries or Applications

   The following libraries or applications must be installed before
   running Kamailio with this module loaded:
     * None

4. Parameters

   4.1. url_skip (str)
   4.2. url_match (str)

4.1. url_skip (str)

   Regular expression to match the HTTP URL. If there is a match, the
   event route is not executed.

   Default value is null (don't skip).

   Example 1.1. Set url_skip parameter
...
modparam("xhttp", "url_skip", "^/RPC2")
...

4.2. url_match (str)

   Regular expression to match the HTTP URL. If there is no match, the
   event route is not executed. This check is done after url_skip, so if
   both url_skip and url_match would match then the event route is not
   executed (url_skip has higher priority).

   Default value is null (match everything).

   Example 1.2. Set url_match parameter
...
modparam("xhttp", "url_match", "^/sip/")
...

5. Functions

   5.1. xhttp_reply(code, reason, ctype, body)

5.1. xhttp_reply(code, reason, ctype, body)

   Send back a reply with content-type and body.

   Example 1.3. xhttp_reply usage
...
event_route[xhttp:request] {
    xhttp_reply("200", "OK", "text/html",
        "<html><body>OK - [$si:$sp]</body></html>");
}
...
