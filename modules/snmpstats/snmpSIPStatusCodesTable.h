 *
 * 3) kamailioSIPStatusCodesTable_can_[activate|deactivate|delete]()
 *   
 * 4) kamailioSIPStatusCodesTable_set_reserve1()

 * 5) kamailioSIPStatusCodesTable_get_value()

 * Specifically, the kamailioSIPStatusCodeIns and kamailioSIPStatusCodeOuts
 * variables don't store the total number of messages sent or received from the
 * system at the time of a SNMP GET request.  Instead, they store the number of
 * messages in or out (with respect to the message code specified by
 * kamailioSIPStatusCodeValue) at the time of the rows *creation*. 
 *
 * When the get request is received, the statistics framework will be queried,
 * and these values subtracted from that query.  This effectively gives us how
 * many of the given message codes have occured since the creation of the row,
 * insead of since Kamailio first loaded up.
