1. Overview

   1.1. General Scalar Statistics
   1.2. SNMP Tables
   1.3. Alarm Monitoring

   The SNMPStats module provides an SNMP management interface to Kamailio.
   Specifically, it provides general SNMP queryable scalar statistics,
   table representations of more complicated data such as user and contact
   information, and alarm monitoring capabilities.

   The MIB has been renamed in version 4.0.0 to reflect the product name.
   Please note that all the OID names has changed, as well as the MIB
   itself.

1.1. General Scalar Statistics

   The SNMPStats module provides a number of general scalar statistics.
   Details are available in KAMAILIO-MIB, KAMAILIO-REG-MIB,
   KAMAILIO-SIP-COMMON-MIB, and KAMAILIO-SIP-SERVER-MIB. But briefly,
   these scalars are:

   kamailioSIPProtocolVersion, kamailioSIPServiceStartTime,
   kamailioSIPEntityType, kamailioSIPSummaryInRequests,
   kamailioSIPSummaryOutRequest, kamailioSIPSummaryInResponses,
   kamailioSIPSummaryOutResponses, kamailioSIPSummaryTotalTransactions,
   kamailioSIPCurrentTransactions, kamailioSIPNumUnsupportedUris,
   kamailioSIPNumUnsupportedMethods, kamailioSIPOtherwiseDiscardedMsgs,
   kamailioSIPProxyStatefulness kamailioSIPProxyRecordRoute,
   kamailioSIPProxyAuthMethod, kamailioSIPNumProxyRequireFailures,
   kamailioSIPRegMaxContactExpiryDuration, kamailioSIPRegMaxUsers,
   kamailioSIPRegCurrentUsers, kamailioSIPRegDfltRegActiveInterval,
   kamailioSIPRegAcceptedRegistrations,
   kamailioSIPRegRejectedRegistrations, kamailioMsgQueueDepth.
   kamailioCurNumDialogs, kamailioCurNumDialogsInProgress,
   kamailioCurNumDialogsInSetup, kamailioTotalNumFailedDialogSetups

   There are also scalars associated with alarms. They are as follows:

   kamailioMsgQueueMinorThreshold, kamailioMsgQueueMajorThreshold,
   kamailioMsgQueueDepthAlarmStatus, kamailioMsgQueueDepthMinorAlarm,
   kamailioMsgQueueDepthMajorAlarm, kamailioDialogLimitMinorThreshold,
   kamailioDialogLimitMajorThreshold, kamailioDialogUsageState,
   kamailioDialogLimitAlarmStatus, kamailioDialogLimitMinorAlarm,
   kamailioDialogLimitMajorAlarm

   In Kamailio 4.1 a set of new OIDs was added to reflect the Kamailio
   configuration, the version, core status (memory, connections),
   transports and module data.

1.2. SNMP Tables

   The SNMPStats module provides several tables, containing more
   complicated data. The current available tables are:

   kamailioSIPPortTable, kamailioSIPMethodSupportedTable,
   kamailioSIPStatusCodesTable, kamailioSIPRegUserTable,
   kamailioSIPContactTable, kamailioSIPRegUserLookupTable

1.3. Alarm Monitoring

   If enabled, the SNMPStats module will monitor for alarm conditions.
   Currently, there are two alarm types defined.
    1. The number of active dialogs has passed a minor or major threshold.
       The idea is that a network operation centre can be made aware that
       their SIP servers may be overloaded, without having to explicitly
       check for this condition.
       If a minor or major condition has occured, then a
       kamailioDialogLimitMinorEvent trap or a
       kamailioDialogLimitMajorEvent trap will be generated, respectively.
       The minor and major thresholds are described in the parameters
       section below.
    2. The number of bytes waiting to be consumed across all of Kamailios
       listening ports has passed a minor or major threshold. The idea is
       that a network operation centre can be made aware that a machine
       hosting a SIP server may be entering a degraded state, and to
       investigate why this is so.
       If the number of bytes to be consumed passes a minor or major
       threshold, then a kamailioMsgQueueDepthMinorEvent or
       kamailioMsgQueueDepthMajorEvent trap will be sent out,
       respectively.

   Full details of these traps can be found in the distributions
   KAMAILIO-MIB file.

2. How it works

   2.1. How the SNMPStats module gets its data
   2.2. How data is moved from the SNMPStats module to a NOC

2.1. How the SNMPStats module gets its data

   The SNMPStats module uses Kamailios internal statistic framework to
   collect most of its data. However, there are two exceptions.
    1. The kamailioSIPRegUserTable and kamailioSIPContactTable rely on the
       usrloc modules callback system. Specifically, the SNMPStats module
       will receive callbacks whenever a user/contact is added to the
       system.
    2. The SNMPStats modules kamailioSIPMsgQueueDepthMinorEvent and
       kamailioSIPMsgQueueDepthMajorEvent alarms rely on the Kamailio core
       to find out what interfaces, ports, and transports Kamailio is
       listening on. However, the module will actually query the proc file
       system to find out the number of bytes waiting to be consumed.
       (Currently, this will only work on systems providing the proc file
       system).

2.2. How data is moved from the SNMPStats module to a NOC

   We have now explained how the SNMPStats module gathers its data. We
   still have not explained how it exports this data to a NOC (Network
   Operations Centre), or administrator.

   The SNMPStats module expects to connect to a Master Agent. This would
   be a NetSNMP daemon running either on the same system as the Kamailio
   instance, or on another system. (Communication can take place over TCP,
   so there is no restriction that this daemon need be on the same system
   as Kamailio).

   If the master agent is unavailable when Kamailio first starts up, the
   SNMPStats module will continue to run. However, you will not be able to
   query it. Thankfully, the SNMPStats module continually looks for its
   master agent. So even if the master agent is started late, or if the
   link to the SNMPStats module is severed due to a temporary hardware
   failure or crashed and restarted master agent, the link will eventually
   be re-established. No data should be lost, and querying can begin
   again.

   To request for this data, you will need to query the master agent. The
   master agent will then redirect the request to the SNMPStats module,
   which will respond to the master agent, which will in turn respond to
   your request.

3. Dependencies

   3.1. Kamailio Modules
   3.2. External Libraries or Applications

3.1. Kamailio Modules

   The SNMPStats module provides a plethora of statistics, some of which
   are collected by other modules. If the dependent modules are not loaded
   then those specific statistics will still be returned, but with zeroed
   values. All other statistics will continue to function normally. This
   means that the SNMPStats module has no hard/mandatory dependencies on
   other modules. There are however, soft dependencies, as follows:
     * usrloc - all scalars and tables relating to users and contacts are
       dependent on the usrloc module. If the module is not loaded, the
       respective tables will be empty.
     * dialog or dialog-ng - all scalars relating to the number of dialogs
       are dependent on the presence of a dialog module. Furthermore, if
       the module is not loaded, then the kamailioDialogLimitMinorEvent,
       and kamailioDialogLimitMajorEvent alarm will be disabled.

   The contents of the kamailioSIPMethodSupportedTable change depending on
   which modules are loaded.

3.2. External Libraries or Applications

   The following libraries or applications must be installed before
   running Kamailio with this module loaded:
     * NetSNMP v5.3 or greater - NetSNMP must be around at the time of
       compilation. Furthermore, there are several shared objects that
       must be loadable at the time SNMPStats is loaded. This means that
       NetSNMP must be installed (but not necessarily running) on the
       system that has loaded the SNMPStats module. (Details can be found
       in the compilation section below).
     * lm_sensors-dev - on some OS-es, this lib is required for
       compilation (http://www.lm-sensors.org/).

4. Parameters

   4.1. sipEntityType (String)
   4.2. MsgQueueMinorThreshold (Integer)
   4.3. MsgQueueMajorThreshold (Integer)
   4.4. dlg_minor_threshold (Integer)
   4.5. dlg_major_threshold (Integer)
   4.6. snmpgetPath (String)
   4.7. snmpCommunity (String)
   4.8. export_registrar (int)

4.1. sipEntityType (String)

   This parameter describes the entity type for this Kamailio instance,
   and will be used in determining what is returned for the
   kamailioSIPEntityType scalar. Valid parameters are:

   registrarServer, redirectServer, proxyServer, userAgent,
   edgeproxyServer, sipcaptureServer,other

   Example 1.1. Setting the sipEntityType parameter
...
modparam("snmpstats", "sipEntityType", "registrarServer")
modparam("snmpstats", "sipEntityType", "proxyServer")
...

   Note that as the above example shows, you can define this parameter
   more than once. This is of course because a given Kamailio instance can
   take on more than one role. The edgeproxyServer is an edge server using
   the outbound module and path extensions. The sipcaptureServer is a
   Homer Sip Capture server that collect SIP messages.

4.2. MsgQueueMinorThreshold (Integer)

   The SNMPStats module monitors the number of bytes waiting to be
   consumed by Kamailio. If the number of bytes waiting to be consumed
   exceeds a minor threshold, the SNMPStats module will send out an
   kamailioMsgQueueDepthMinorEvent trap to signal that an alarm condition
   has occured. The minor threshold is set with the MsgQueueMinorThreshold
   parameter.

   Example 1.2. Setting the MsgQueueMinorThreshold parameter
...
modparam("snmpstats", "MsgQueueMinorThreshold", 2000)
...

   If this parameter is not set, then there will be no minor alarm
   monitoring.

4.3. MsgQueueMajorThreshold (Integer)

   The SNMPStats module monitors the number of bytes waiting to be
   consumed by Kamailio. If the number of bytes waiting to be consumed
   exceeds a major threshold, the SNMPStats module will send out an
   kamailioMsgQueueDepthMajorEvent trap to signal that an alarm condition
   has occured. The major threshold is set with the MsgQueueMajorThreshold
   parameter.

   Example 1.3. Setting the MsgQueueMajorThreshold parameter
...
modparam("snmpstats", "MsgQueueMajorThreshold", 5000)
...

   If this parameter is not set, then there will be no major alarm
   monitoring.

4.4. dlg_minor_threshold (Integer)

   The SNMPStats module monitors the number of active dialogs. If the
   number of active dialogs exceeds a minor threshold, the SNMPStats
   module will send out an kamailioDialogLimitMinorEvent trap to signal
   that an alarm condition has occured. The minor threshold is set with
   the dlg_minor_threshold parameter.

   Example 1.4. Setting the dlg_minor_threshold parameter
...
  modparam("snmpstats", "dlg_minor_threshold", 500)
...

   If this parameter is not set, then there will be no minor alarm
   monitoring.

4.5. dlg_major_threshold (Integer)

   The SNMPStats module monitors the number of active dialogs. If the
   number of active dialogs exceeds a major threshold, the SNMPStats
   module will send out an kamailioDialogLimitMajorEvent trap to signal
   that an alarm condition has occured. The major threshold is set with
   the dlg_major_threshold parameter.

   Example 1.5. Setting the dlg_major_threshold parameter
...
  modparam("snmpstats", "dlg_major_threshold", 750)
...

   If this parameter is not set, then there will be no major alarm
   monitoring.

4.6. snmpgetPath (String)

   The SNMPStats module provides the kamailioSIPServiceStartTime scalar.
   This scalar requires the SNMPStats module to perform a snmpget query to
   the master agent. You can use this parameter to set the path to your
   instance of NetSNMP's snmpget program.

   Default value is "/usr/local/bin/".

   Example 1.6. Setting the snmpgetPath parameter
...
modparam("snmpstats", "snmpgetPath",     "/my/custom/path/")
...

4.7. snmpCommunity (String)

   The SNMPStats module provides the kamailioSIPServiceStartTime scalar.
   This scalar requires the SNMPStats module to perform a snmpget query to
   the master agent. If you have defined a custom community string for the
   snmp daemon, you need to specify it with this parameter.

   Default value is "public".

   Example 1.7. Setting the snmpCommunity parameter
...
modparam("snmpstats", "snmpCommunity", "customCommunityString")
...

4.8. export_registrar (int)

   The SNMPStats module will export registrar (usrloc) records if this
   parameter is set to 1. This will result in more memory usage and bigger
   exporter structure.

   Default value is "0" (don't export).

   Example 1.8. Setting the export_registrar parameter
...
modparam("snmpstats", "export_registrar", 1)
...

5. Functions

   Currently, there are no exported functions.

6. Installation and Running

   6.1. Compiling the SNMPStats Module
   6.2. Configuring NetSNMP to allow connections from the SNMPStats
          module.

   6.3. Configuring the SNMPStats module for communication with a Master
          Agent

   6.4. Testing for a proper Configuration

   There are several things that need to be done to get the SNMPStats
   module compiled and up and running.

6.1. Compiling the SNMPStats Module

   In order for the SNMPStats module to compile, you will need at least
   version 5.3 of the NetSNMP source code. The source can be found at:
    http://net-snmp.sourceforge.net/

   For the specifics of installing NetSNMP, please see the INSTALL
   document in the root of the NetSNMP source package.

   The SNMPStats modules makefile requires that the NetSNMP script
   "net-snmp-config" can run. At a minimum, running "net-snmp-config
   --agent-libs" from the Kamailio source directory should return
   something similar to:
    -L/usr/local/lib -lnetsnmpmibs -lnetsnmpagent -lnetsnmphelpers -lnetsnmp

   The specifics of what is returned depends on how the system was
   configured. If your NetSNMP installation was installed from an RPM (or
   another packaged version), then there is a good chance that
   net-snmp-config will return something unecessarily longer. It is highly
   recommended you install NetSNMP from source to avoid bringing in
   excessive dependencies to the SNMPStats module.

6.2. Configuring NetSNMP to allow connections from the SNMPStats module.

   The SNMPStats module will communicate with the NetSNMP Master Agent.
   This communication happens over a protocol known as AgentX. This means
   that NetSNMP must have been compiled with AgentX support. This will
   always be the case when you are compiling from source unless you
   explicitly removed AgentX support with ./configure.

   After AgentX support has been compiled into NetSNMP, its configuration
   file needs to be changed to turn on AgentX support. The exact location
   of the configuration file (snmpd.conf) may vary depending on your
   system. On my system, it is located in:
    /usr/local/share/snmp/snmpd.conf.

   At the very end of the file add the following line:
    master agentx

   The line tells NetSNMP to act as an AgentX master agent, so that it can
   accept connections from sub-agents such as the SNMPStats module.

   There is still one last step. Even though we have compiled and
   configured NetSNMP to have AgentX support, we still need to tell the
   daemon which interface and port to listen to for AgentX connections.
   This is done when the daemon is started as follows:
    snmpd -x mySystemName:PortNumber

   On my system, I start the NetSNMP daemon with:
    snmpd -x localhost:705

   This tells NetSNMP to act as a master agent, listening on the localhost
   UDP interface at port 705.

6.3. Configuring the SNMPStats module for communication with a Master Agent

   The previous section explained how to set up a NetSNMP master agent to
   accept AgentX connections. We now need to tell the SNMPStats module how
   to communicate with this master agent. This is done by giving the
   SNMPStats module its own NetSNMP configuration file. The file must be
   named snmpstats.conf, and must be in the same folder as the snmpd.conf
   file that was configured above. On my system this would be:
    /usr/local/share/snmp/snmpstats.conf

   The default configuration file included with the distribution can be
   used, and contains the following:
    agentXSocket tcp:localhost:705

   The above line tells the SNMPStats module to register with the master
   agent on the localhost, port 705. The parameters should match up with
   the snmpd process. Note that the master agent (snmpd) does not need to
   be present on the same machine as Kamailio. localhost could be replaced
   with any other machine.

6.4. Testing for a proper Configuration

   As a quick test to make sure that the SNMPStats module sub-agent can
   succesfully connect to the NetSNMP Master agent, start snmpd with the
   following:
    snmpd -f -Dagentx -x tcp:localhost:705 2>&1 | less

   You should see something similar to the following:
    No log handling enabled - turning on stderr logging
    registered debug token agentx, 1
    ...
    Turning on AgentX master support.
    agentx/master: initializing...
    agentx/master: initializing...   DONE
    NET-SNMP version 5.3.1

   Now, start up Kamailio in another window. In the snmpd window, you
   should see a bunch of:
    agentx/master: handle pdu (req=0x2c58ebd4,trans=0x0,sess=0x0)
    agentx/master: open 0x81137c0
    agentx/master: opened 0x814bbe0 = 6 with flags = a0
    agentx/master: send response, stat 0 (req=0x2c58ebd4,trans=0x0,sess=0x0)
    agentx_build: packet built okay

   The messages beginning with "agentx" are debug messages stating that
   something is happening with an AgentX sub-agent, appearing because of
   the -Dagentx snmpd switch. The large number of debug messages appear at
   startup as the SNMPStats module registers all of its scalars and tables
   with the Master Agent. If you receive these messages, then SNMPStats
   module and NetSNMP daemon have both been configured correctly.

   2.11. Where can I post a question about this module?
   2.12. How can I report a bug?

   2.1.

   Where can I find more about SNMP?

   There are many websites that explain SNMP at all levels of detail. A
   great general introduction can be found at
   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SNMP If you are interested in the nitty
   gritty details of the protocol, then please look at RFC 3410. RFC 3410
   maps out the many other RFCs that define SNMP, and can be found at
   http://www.rfc-archive.org/getrfc.php?rfc=3410

   2.2.

   Where can I find more about NetSNMP?

   NetSNMP source code, documentation, FAQs, and tutorials can all be
   found at http://net-snmp.sourceforge.net/.

   2.3.

   Where can I find out more about AgentX?

   The full details of the AgentX protocol are explained in RFC 2741,
   available at: http://www.rfc-archive.org/getrfc.php?rfc=2741

   2.4.

   Why am I not receiving any SNMP Traps?

   Assuming you've configured the trap thresholds in kamailio.cfg with
   something similar to:
    modparam("snmpstats", "MsgQueueMinorThreshold", 1234)
    modparam("snmpstats", "MsgQueueMajorThreshold", 5678)

    modparam("snmpstats", "dlg_minor_threshold", 500)
    modparam("snmpstats", "dlg_minor_threshold", 600)

   Then either Kamailio is not reaching these thresholds (which is a good
   thing), or you haven't set up the trap monitor correctly. To prove this
   to yourself, you can start NetSNMP with:
    snmpd -f -Dtrap -x localhost:705

   The -f tells the NetSNMP process to not daemonize, and the -Dtrap
   enables trap debug logs. You should see something similar to the
   following:
    registered debug token trap, 1
    trap: adding callback trap sink            ----- You should see both
    trapsess: adding to trap table             ----- of these lines.
    Turning on AgentX master support.
    trap: send_trap 0 0 NET-SNMP-TC::linux
    trap: sending trap type=167, version=1
    NET-SNMP version 5.3.1

   If the two lines above did not appear, then you probably have not
   included the following in your snmpd.conf file.
    trap2sink machineToSendTrapsTo:machinesPortNumber.

   When a trap has been received by snmpd, the following will appear in
   the above output:
    sent_trap -1 -1 NET-SNMP-TC::linus
    sending trap type=167, version=1

   You'll also need a program to collect the traps and do something with
   them (such as sending them to syslog). NetSNMP provides snmptrapd for
   this. Other solutions exist as well. Google is your friend.

   2.5.

   Kamailio refuses to load the SNMPStats module. Why is it displaying
   "load_module: could not open module snmpstats.so"?

   On some systems, you may receive the following error at stdout or the
   log files depending on the configuration.
    ERROR: load_module: could not open module </usr/local/lib/kamailio/modules_k
/snmpstats.so>:
           libnetsnmpmibs.so.10: cannot open shared object file: No such file or
 directory.

   This means one of two things:
    1. You did not install NetSNMP. ("make install" if building from
       source)
    2. The dynamic linker cannot find the necessary libraries.

   In the second case, the fix is as follows:
    1. find / -name "libnetsnmpmibs*"
          + You will find a copy unless you haven't installed NetSNMP.
            Make note of the path.
    2. less /etc/ld.so.conf
          + If the file is missing the path from step 1, then add the path
            to ld.so.conf
    3. ldconfig
    4. Try starting Kamailio again.

   Alternatively, you may prefix your startup command with:
    LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/path/noted/in/step/one/above

   For example, on my system I ran:
    LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib kamctl start

   How can I learn what all the scalars and tables are?

   All scalars and tables are named in the SNMPStats module overview. The
   files KAMAILIO-MIB, KAMAILIO-REG-MIB, KAMAILIO-SIP-COMMON-MIB and
   KAMAILIO-SIP-SERVER-MIB contain the full definitions and descriptions.
   Note however, that the MIBs may actually contain scalars and tables
   which are currently not provided by the SNMPStats module. Therefore, it
   is better to use NetSNMP's snmptranslate as an alternative. Take the
   kamailioSIPEntityType scalar as an example. You can invoke
   snmptranslate as follows:
    snmptranslate -TBd kamailioSIPEntityType

   Which would result in something similar to the following:
    -- FROM       KAMAILIO-SIP-COMMON-MIB
    -- TEXTUAL CONVENTION KamailioSIPEntityRole
    SYNTAX        BITS {other(0), userAgent(1), proxyServer(2), redirectServer(3
), registrarServer(4)}
    MAX-ACCESS    read-only
    STATUS        current
    DESCRIPTION   " This object identifies the list of SIP entities this
                   row is related to. It is defined as a bit map.  Each
                   bit represents a type of SIP entity.
                   If a bit has value 1, the SIP entity represented by
                   this row plays the role of this entity type.

                   If a bit has value 0, the SIP entity represented by
                   this row does not act as this entity type
                   Combinations of bits can be set when the SIP entity
                   plays multiple SIP roles."

   Why do snmpget, snmpwalk, and snmptable always time out?

   If your snmp operations are always returning with: "Timeout: No
   Response from localhost", then chances are that you are making the
   query with the wrong community string. Default installs will most
   likely use "public" as their default community strings. Grep your
   snmpd.conf file for the string "rocommunity", and use the result as
   your community string in your queries.

   2.8.

   How do I use snmpget?

   NetSNMP's snmpget is used as follows:
    snmpget -v 2c -c theCommunityString machineToSendTheMachineTo scalarElement.
0

   For example, consider an snmpget on the kamailioSIPEntityType scalar,
   run on the same machine running the Kamailio instance, with the default
   "public" community string. The command would be:
    snmpget -v2c -c public localhost kamailioSIPEntityType.0

   Which would result in something similar to:
    KAMAILIO-SIP-COMMON-MIB::kamailioSIPEntityType.0 = BITS: F8 \
                other(0) userAgent(1) proxyServer(2)          \
                redirectServer(3) registrarServer(4)

   2.9.

   How do I use snmptable?

   NetSNMP's snmptable is used as follows:
    snmptable -Ci -v 2c -c theCommunityString machineToSendTheMachineTo theTable
Name

   For example, consider the kamailioSIPRegUserTable. If we run the
   snmptable command on the same machine as the running Kamailio instance,
   configured with the default "public" community string. The command
   would be:
    snmptable -Ci -v 2c -c public localhost kamailioSIPRegUserTable

   Which would result in something similar to:
    index kamailioSIPUserUri kamailioSIPUserAuthenticationFailures
        1       DefaultUser                                    0
        2            bogdan                                    0
