Overview

   The module supports triggering specific route block on timer.

Dependencies

   none

ABNF syntax

        timer_id = alphanum
        slow_fast = "slow" | "fast"
        declare_timer_syntax = timer_id "=" (route#|route_name) "," interval ",
" slow_fast "," ["enable"]
        enable_disable = "0" | "1"

Parameters

declare_timer (string)

   Declares timer route which will be called in specific interval.

   The format is:
                        declare_timer = declare_timer_syntax

   timer_id is timer identifier, route is handler to be called when timer is
   triggered, interval is timer interval in milliseconds, slow_fast determines
   if handler will be hooked in slow or fast timer queue, fast timer handler
   returns as quickly as possible, slow timer handler may spend longer time,
   see ser/doc/timers.txt documentation. Use enable to enable timer when ser is
   starting, otherwise use timer_enable to start it later.

   Example 1. Example declare_timer
        ...
        modparam("timer", "declare_timer", "MY_TIMER=MY_TIMER_ROUTE,10,slow,ena
ble");
        ...

Functions

timer_enable(timer_id, enable_disable)

   Enable/disable timer route specified by timer_id. Because of timer core API
   the callback is not disabled immediately but is removed from handler by
   itself not to decrease performance. Disabling and enabling in sequence may
   be tricky. timer_id references to timer declared by declare_timer.

   Example 2. timer_enable usage
        ...
        timer_enable("MY_TIMER", 1);
        ...

@timer.timer.timer_id.enabled

   Return true ("1") if timer specified by timer_id is enabled, otherwise
   returns false ("0").

   Example 3. timer.timer.timer_id.enabled usage
        if (@timer.timer.MY_TIMER.enabled == "1") {
        ....
        }

@timer.executed

   Returns name of timer which has been executed, i.e. non empty value is
   returned only when handler is being processed.

   Example 4. timer.executed usage
        if (@timer.executed != "") {
                # timer is being handled
        ....
        }

Examples

   Example 5. timer common example
loadmodule "modules/xlog/xlog.so"
loadmodule "modules/timer/timer.so"

modparam("timer", "declare_timer", "tmr1=ONTIMER,1000");
modparam("timer", "declare_timer", "tmr2=ONTIMER2,2000,slow,enable");

route["print"] {
        xlog("L_INFO", "fired: %@timer.executed\n");
}

route["ONTIMER"] {
        # do something
        route("print");}


route["ONTIMER2"] {
        # do something
        timer_enable("tmr1", 0);
        route("print");
}
