Overview

   It  provides  similar functionality as nathelper but communicates with
   netfilter kernel xt_RTPPROXY module using libipt_RTPPROXY userspace library.
   See http://www.2p.cz/en/netfilter_rtp_proxy All RTP streams are manipulated
   directly in kernel space, no data are copied from kernel to userspace and
   back, it reduces load and delay.

   The ser module is written as light-weighted, there is not implemented any
   dialog managment as in nathelper, the reason is that such API should be
   provided by core or specialized dialog manager module. Because such module
   is not in CVS, session information may be stored in extra attributes of
   avp_db  module and session id itself in record route as cookie, see rr
   module.

   It should be able to support all cases as re-invites when SIP client offers
   media change in SDP and when number of medias in offer/answer are different.

   Nathelper may be still used for testing if client is behind the NAT.

   Limitations:
     * only IPv4 addresses are supported.
     * more media streams per session supported

Dependencies

   The following libraries or applications must be installed before running SER
   with this module loaded:
     * netfilter       xt_RTPROXY       &       libipt_RTPPROXY,      see
       http://www.2p.cz/en/netfilter_rtp_proxy

Parameters

switchboard (string)

   References xt_RTPPROXY switchboard for usage by ser module.

   The format is:
  name "=" value * ( ";" name "=" value )

  name =  "name" | ( ( "addr-" | "port-" | "learning-timeout-" | "always-learn-
") ("a" | "b") )

   The meaning of parameters is described in libipt_RTPROXY and iptrtpproxy
   documentation.

   The name" is identifier that will be used by script functions and references
   switchboard. It's mandatory parameter. More switchboards may be declared.

   Example 1. Declare switchboard
        ...
        modparam("iptrtpproxy", "switchboard", "name=my;addr-a=1.2.3.4;port-a=5
0000");
        ...

Functions

iptrtpproxy_alloc(gate_a_to_b, switchboard_id)

   Parses SDP content and allocates for each RTP media stream one RTP proxy
   session. SDP is updates to reflect allocated sessions.
     * if gate_a_to_b non equal to zero then SDP regards to gate-a to gate-b
       direction.
     * switchboard_id is reference to a switchboard with name declared as
       switchboard modparam.
     * function returns true is a session was created, identifier is available
       via select @iptrtpproxy.session_ids.

   Example 2. iptrtpproxy_alloc usage
        ...
        if (iptrtpproxy_alloc("1", "my")) {
          $sess_ids = @iptrtpproxy.session_ids;
          # save sess_ids in dialog
        }
        ...

iptrtpproxy_update(gate_a_to_b, session_ids)

   Parses SDP content and updates sessions provided by session_ids and updates
   SDP. If succesfull then session_ids may be changed (in case e.g. media
   stream  has  port  zero particular session is released), the result of
   @iptrtpproxy.session_ids should be stored for future in-dialog usage.
     * if gate_a_to_b non equal to zero then SDP regards to gate-a to gate-b
       direction.

   Example 3. iptrtpproxy_update usage
        ...
        # load $sess_ids from dialog
        if (iptrtpproxy_update("0", $sess_ids)) {
          $sess_ids = @iptrtpproxy.session_ids;
          # save sess_ids in dialog
        }
        ...

iptrtpproxy_delete(session_ids)

   Delete sessions identified by session_ids. May be used when dialog is being
   destroyed (BYE) or when INVITE failed in failure route.

   Example 4. iptrtpproxy_delete usage
        ...
        # load $sess_ids from dialog
        iptrtpproxy_delete($sess_ids);
        ...

@iptrtpproxy.session_ids

   Returns sessions allocated/updated in iptrtpproxy_alloc/update.

   The format is:
        switchboard_name [ ":" [ session_id *( "," session_id) ] ]
        session_id = *( [0-9] )   ; empty when no session allocated

@iptrtpproxy.sdp_ip

   Return first rewritten IP provided in SDP c= line.
