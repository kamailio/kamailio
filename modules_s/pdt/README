 PDT - prefix-domain translation
 ===============================

1.Description
-------------

This module translates numerical codes into domains and update accordingly 
the R-URI.

The module looks up at the R-URI part of a message and if the user part begins 
with an established prefix it will update the uri. Updating the uri consists 
of: read the code after the prefix from the user part of the uri and keep the
rest as the user part of the new uri. The host part will be the domain matched 
for the leading code.

    [<prefix>]<code><userid><:password>@<mydomain.com> ...
    
    and the result will be:
    
    <userid><:password>@<domain[:port]>...
    
Example:
    prefix=2
    code=3330
    domain[3330]=iptel.org
    
    
    2333091001@mydomain.com  => 91001@iptel.org    
    
The code is always ended with a special digit (a parameter of the module).
This digit will not be inside the code at all.

------------------
Methods
-------

Name: 	prefix2domain
Params:	none
Desc:	build a new uri if it is necessary. Returns 1 when the translation was
        made or there was nothing to translate (user part of the URI is empty
		or it does not match the prefix parameter). Returns -1 in error cases.


Parameters
----------

Name:		db_url
Type:		string
Default:	sql://root@127.0.0.1/pdt
Desc:		SQL URL of database - username, password, host, port and 
		database (ex: sql://username:password@hostname.com/database)


Name:		db_table
Type:		string
Default:	domains
Desc:		table name


Name:		terminator
Type:		int
Default:	0
Desc:		the digit ending a code


Name:		start_range
Type:		int
Default:	10
Desc:		default start value for allocating prefixes


Name:		prefix
Type:		string
Default:	NULL
Desc:		default prefix who denotes what uri needs to be translated
            -- if it is NULL the module will not check the R-URI against it and
            the code is considered starting from the first digit. Otherwise, the
            module will check first if the R-URI starts with it and will skip it
            to find the code

Name:       	hsize_2pow
Type:       	int
Default:    	4
Desc:       	number of the hash entries = 2^hash_size

5.Some details


The module registers also a function that works with the fifo server
( get_domaincode ). 
That will provide support for a web user interface which will be used by admins
to register new domains and by simple users to find the code for a domain.


Registered domains are stored in a database and in tables in share memory. The 
database is kept consistent with the tables in memory. When a new domain is 
registered the information goes first in the database and only than in tables 
in share memory.  
        
Data in share memory is kept in hashtables to have fast searches. Searches are 
possible for domains, but also for codes. Searches for codes are necessary more 
often, every time when a message that needs to be translated passes through SER.
Searches for domains are requested by the user interface only.

Through the web interface a normal user can find the code for a domain and a 
privileged user (i.e., admins) can register new domains too.
The web interface also encounters problems of mutual exclusion. Any user of the 
interface posts a request to the fifo server and waits his response in a file. 
The file must be unique per user to avoid interfering responses for different 
simultaneous user. That problem is solved using session per user offered by 
the PHP language.
