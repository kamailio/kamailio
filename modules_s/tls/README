Overview

   This module implements the TLS transport for ser using the openssl
   library (http://www.openssl.org). To enable the TLS support this
   module must be loaded and enable_tls=yes must be added to the ser
   config file

Quick Start

   Make sure you have a proper certificate and private key and either use
   the certificate and private_key module parameters, or make sure the
   certificate and key are in the same PEM file, named cert.pem an placed
   in [your-cfg-install-prefix]/etc/ser/. Don't forget to load the tls
   module and to enable tls (add enable_tls=yes to your config).

   Example 1. quick start config
#...
loadmodule "modules/tls/tls.so"

modparam("tls", "private_key", "./andrei-test.pem")
modparam("tls", "certificate", "./andrei-test.pem")
modparam("tls", "ca_list", "./calist.pem")

enable_tls=yes

route{
        # ....
}

Important Notes

   The tls module needs some special options enabled when compiling ser.
   These options are enabled by default, however in case you're using a
   modified ser version or Makefile, make sure that you enable -DUSE_TLS
   and -DTLS_HOOKS (or compile with make TLS_HOOKS=1 which will take care
   of both options). To quickly check if your ser version was compiled
   with these options, run ser -V and look for USE_TLS and TLS_HOOKS
   among the flags.

   This module includes several workarounds for various openssl bugs
   (like compression and kerberos using the wrong memory allocations
   functions, low memory problems a.s.o). On startup it will try to
   enable the needed workarounds based on the openssl library version.
   Each time a known problem is detected and a workaround is enabled, a
   message will be logged. In general it is recommended to compile this
   module on the same machine or a similar machine to where ser will be
   run or to link it statically with libssl. For example if on the
   compile machine openssl does not have the kerberos support enabled,
   but on the target machine a kerberos enabled openssl library is
   installed, ser cannot apply the needed workarounds and will refuse to
   start. The same thing will happen if the openssl versions are too
   different (to force ser startup anyway, see the tls_force_run module
   parameter).

   Try to avoid using keys larger then 1024 bytes. Large keys
   significantly slow down the TLS connection handshake, thus limiting
   the maximum ser TLS connection rate.

   Compression is fully supported and used by default, if you have a new
   enough openssl version (starting with 0.9.8). Although there are some
   problems with zlib compression in currently deployed openssl versions
   (up to and including 0.9.8d, see openssl bug #1468), the tls module
   will automatically switch to its own fixed version. There's no need to
   force-disable the compression.

   The tls module includes workarounds for the following known openssl
   bugs: openssl #1204 (disable SS_OP_TLS_BLOCK_PADDING_BUG if
   compression is enabled, for versions between 0.9.8 and 0.9.8c),
   openssl #1468 (fix zlib compression memory allocation), openssl #1467
   (kerberos support will be disabled if the openssl version is less than
   0.9.8e-beta1) and openssl #1491 (stop using tls in low memory
   situations due to the very high risk of openssl crashing or leaking
   memory). The bug reports can be viewed at http://rt.openssl.org/.

Compiling the TLS Module

   In most case compiling the TLS module is as simple as:
make modules modules=modules/tls

   or
cd modules/tls
make

   or (compiling whole ser and the tls module)
make all include_modules=tls

   .

   However in some cases the openssl library requires linking with other
   libraries. For example compiling the openssl library with kerberos and
   zlib-shared support will require linking the tls module with libkrb5
   and libz. In this case just add TLS_EXTRA_LIBS="library list" to
   make's command line. E.g.:
make TLS_EXTRA_LIBS="-lkrb5 -lz" all include_modules=tls

   In general, if ser fails to start with a symbol not found error when
   trying to load the tls module (check the log), it means some needed
   library was not linked and it must be added to TLS_EXTRA_LIBS

TLS and Low Memory

   The openssl library doesn't handle very well low memory situations. If
   memory allocations start to fail (due to memory shortage), openssl can
   crash or cause memory leaks (making the memory shortage even worse).
   As of this writing all openssl versions were affected (includind
   0.9.8e), see openssl bug #1491. The tls module has some workarounds
   for preventing this problem (see low_mem_treshold1 and
   low_mem_threshold2), however starting ser with enough shared memory is
   higly recommended. When this is not possible a quick way to
   significantly reduce openssl memory usage it to disable compression
   (see tls_disable_compression).

Known Limitations

   The private key must not encrypted (ser cannot ask you for a password
   on startup).

   The tls certificate verifications ignores the certificate name,
   altname and ip extensions, it just checks if the certificate is signed
   by a recognized CA. One can use the select framework to try to
   overcome this limitation (check in the script for the contents of
   various certificate fields), but this is not only slow, but also not
   exactly standard conforming (the verification should happen during TLS
   connection establishment and not after).

   TLS specific config reloading is not safe, so for now better don't use
   it, especially under heavy traffic.

   This documentation is incomplete. The select framework and rpc
   sections are completely missing.

Quick Certificate Howto

   Revision History
   Revision $Revision$ $Date$

   There are various ways to create, sign certificates and manage small
   CAs (Certificate Authorities). If you want a GUI, try tinyca
   (http://tinyca.sm-zone.net/), a very nice and small CA management
   application. If you are in a hurry and everything you have are the
   installed openssl libraries and utilities, read on.

   Assumptions: we run our own CA.

   Warning: in this example no key is encrypted. The client and server
   private keys must not be encrypted (ser doesn't support encrypted
   keys), so make sure the corresponding files are readable only by
   trusted people. You should use a password for your CA private key.

Creating CA certificate
-----------------------
1. create CA dir
        mkdir ca
        cd ca

2. create ca dir structure and files  (see ca(1))
        mkdir demoCA #default CA name, edit /etc/ss/openssl.cnf
        mkdir  demoCA/private
        mkdir demoCA/newcerts
        touch demoCA/index.txt
        echo 01 >demoCA/serial

2. create CA private key
        openssl genrsa -out demoCA/private/cakey.pem 2048
        chmod 600 demoCA/private/cakey.pem

3. create CA self-signed certificate
        openssl req -out demoCA/cacert.pem   -x509 -new -key demoCA/private/cak
ey.pem


Creating a server/client certificate
------------------------------------
1. create a certificate request (and its private key in privkey.pem)
        openssl req -out ser1_cert_req.pem -new -nodes
   WARNING: the organization name should be the same as in the ca certificate.

2. sign it with the ca certificate
        openssl ca -in ser1_cert_req.pem -out ser1_cert.pem

3. copy ser1_cert.pem to your ser config. dir


Setting ser to use the certificate
----------------------------------
1. create the ca list file:
        for each of your ca certificates that you intend to use do:
                cat cacert.pem >>calist.pem

2. copy your ser certificate, private key and ca list file to your
        intended machine (preferably in your ser cfg. directory, this is the
        default place ser searches for)

3. set up ser.cfg to use the certificate
        if your ser certificate name is different from cert.pem or it is not
        placed in ser cfg. directory, add to your ser.cfg:
                modparam("tls", "certificate", "/path/cert_file_name")

4. set up ser to use the private key
        if your private key is not contained in the certificate (or the
         certificate name is not the default cert.pem), add to your ser.cfg:
                modparam("tls", "private_key", "/path/private_key_file")

5. set up ser to use the ca list (optional)
        add to your ser.cfg:
                modparam("tls", "ca_list", "/path/ca_list_file")

6. set up tls authentication options:
                modparam("tls", "verify_certificate", 1)
                modparam("tls", "require_certificate", 1)
        (for more information see the module parameters documentation)

Parameters

   Revision History
   Revision $Revision$ $Date$

tls_method (string)

   Sets the SSL protocol method. Possible values are:
     * TLSv1 - only TLSv1 connections are accepted. This is the default
       and recommended method (if you want to be rfc3261 conformant don't
       change it).
     * SSLv3 - only SSLv3 connections are accepted
     * SSLv2 - only SSLv2 connections, for old clients. Note: you
       shouldn't use SSLv2 for anything which should be highly secure.
     * SSLv23 - any of the above methods will be accepted, with the
       following limitation: the initial SSL hello message must be V2 (in
       the initial hello all the supported protocols are advertised
       enabling switching to a higher and more secure version). This
       means connections from SSLv3 or TLSv1 clients will not be
       accepted.

   If rfc3261 conformance is desired, TLSv1 must be used. For
   compatibility with older clients SSLv23 is a good option.

   Example 2. Set tls_method parameter
...
modparam("tls", "tls_method", "TLSv1")
...

certificate (string)

   Sets the certificate file name. The certificate file can also contain
   the private key.

   Warning: try not to use certificate with keys longer then 1024 bytes.
   Longer keys will severely impact performance, in particular the tls
   connection rate.

   The default value is [SER_CFG_DIR]/cert.pem.

   Example 3. Set certificate parameter
...
modparam("tls", "certificate", "/usr/local/etc/ser/my_certificate.pem")
...

private_key (string)

   Sets the private key file name.

   Note: the private key can be contained in the same file as the
   certificate (just append it to the certificate file, e.g.: cat
   pkey.pem >> cert.pem)

   The default value is [SER_CFG_DIR]/cert.pem.

   Example 4. Set private_key parameter
...
modparam("tls", "private", "/usr/local/etc/ser/my_pkey.pem")
...

ca_list (string)

   Sets the CA list file name. This file contains a list of all the
   trusted CAs certificates. If a signature in a certificate chain
   belongs to one of the listed CAs, the authentication will succeed. See
   also verify_certificate, verify_depth and require_certificate.

   By default the CA file is not set.

   An easy way to create the CA list is to append each trusted trusted CA
   certificate in the PEM format to one file, e.g.: for f in
   trusted_cas/*.pem ; do cat "$f" >> ca_list.pem ; done .

   Example 5. Set ca_list parameter
...
modparam("tls", "ca_list", "/usr/local/etc/ser/ca_list.pem")
...

verify_certificate (boolean)

   If enabled it will force certificate verification. For more
   information see the verify(1) openssl man page.

   Note: the certificate verification will always fail if the ca_list is
   empty.

   See also: ca_list, require_certificate, verify_depth.

   By default the certificate verification is off.

   Example 6. Set verify_certificate parameter
...
modparam("tls", "verify_certificate", 1)
...

verify_depth (integer)

   Sets how far up the certificate chain will the certificate
   verification go in the search for a trusted CA.

   See also: ca_list, require_certificate, verify_certificate,

   The default value is 9.

   Example 7. Set verify_depth parameter
...
modparam("tls", "verify_depth", 9)
...

require_certificate (boolean)

   When enabled it will require a certificate from a client. If the
   client does not offer a certificate and verify_certificate is on, the
   certificate verification will fail.

   The default value is off.

   Example 8. Set require_certificate parameter
...
modparam("tls", "require_certificate", 1)
...

cipher_list (string)

   Sets the list of accepted ciphers. The list consists of cipher strings
   separated by colons. For more information on the cipher list format
   see the cipher(1) openssl man page.

   The default value is not set (all the openssl supported ciphers are
   enabled).

   Example 9. Set cipher_list parameter
...
modparam("tls", "cipher_list", "HIGH")
...

send_timeout (int)

   Sets the maximum interval of time after which ser will give up trying
   to send a message over tls (time after a tls send will be aborted and
   the corresponding tls connection closed). The value is in seconds.

   The default value is 120 s.

   Example 10. Set send_timeout parameter
...
modparam("tls", "send_timeout", 1)
...

handshake_timeout (int)

   Sets the maximum interval of time after which ser will give up trying
   to accept a tls connection or connect to a tls peer. The value is in
   seconds.

   The default value is 120 s.

   Example 11. Set handshake_timeout parameter
...
modparam("tls", "handshake_timeout", 1)
...

connection_timeout (int)

   Sets the amount of time after which an idle tls connection will be
   closed. This is similar to tcp_connection_lifetime. The value is
   expressed in seconds.

   The default value is 10 min.

   If the value set is -1, the connection will never be close on idle.

   Example 12. Set connection_timeout parameter
...
modparam("tls", "connection_timeout", 60)
...

tls_disable_compression (boolean)

   If set compression over SSL/TLS will be disabled.

   By default compression is enabled.

   Example 13. Set tls_disable_compression parameter
...
modparam("tls", "tls_disable_compression", 1)
...

tls_log (int)

   Sets the log level at which tls related messages will be logged.

   The default value is 3.

   Example 14. Set tls_log parameter
...
# ignore tls messages if ser is started with debug less than 10
modparam("tls", "tls_log", 10)
...

low_mem_threshold1 (integer)

   Sets the minimal free memory from which new tls connection will start
   to fail. The value is expressed in KB.

   The default value depends on whether the openssl library used handles
   well low memory situations (openssl bug #1491). As of this writing
   this is not true for any openssl version (including 0.9.8e).

   If an ill-behaved openssl version is detected, a very conservative
   value is choosed, which depends on the maximum possible number of
   simultaneously created tls connections (and hence on the process
   number).

   The following values have a special meaning:
     * -1 - use the default value
     * 0 - disable (tls connections will not fail preemptively)

   See also low_mem_threshold2.

   Example 15. Set low_memory_threshold1 parameter
...
modparam("tls", "low_memory_threshold1", -1)
...

low_mem_threshold2 (integer)

   Sets the minimal free memory from which tls operations on already
   established tls connections will start to fail preemptively. The value
   is expressed in KB.

   The default value depends on whether the openssl library used handles
   well low memory situations (openssl bug #1491). As of this writing
   this is not true for any openssl version (including 0.9.8e).

   If an ill-behaved openssl version is detected, a very conservative
   value is choosed, which depends on the maximum possible number of
   simultaneously created tls connections (and hence on the process
   number).

   The following values have a special meaning:
     * -1 - use the default value
     * 0 - disable (tls operations will not fail preemptively)

   See also low_mem_threshold1.

   Example 16. Set low_memory_threshold2 parameter
...
modparam("tls", "low_memory_threshold2", -1)
...

tls_force_run (boolean)

   If enabled ser will start even if some of the openssl sanity checks
   fail (turn it on at your own risk).

   Currently failing any of the following sanity checks will not allow
   ser to start:
     * the version of the library the tls module was compiled with is
       "too different" from the library used at runtime. The versions
       should have the same major, minor and fix level (e.g.: 0.9.8a and
       0.9.8c are ok, but 0.9.8 and 0.9.9 are not)
     * the openssl library used at compile time and the one used at
       runtime have different kerberos options

   By default tls_force_run is disabled.

   Example 17. Set tls_force_run parameter
...
modparam("tls", "tls_force_run", 11)
...

config (string)

   Sets the name of the TLS specific config file.

   If set the tls module will load a special config file, in which
   different tls parameters can be specified on a per role (server or
   client) and domain basis (for now only IPs). The corresponding module
   parameters will be ignored.

   By default no config file is specified.

   The following parameters can be set in the config file, for each
   domain:
     * tls_method
     * verify_certificate
     * require_certificate
     * private_key
     * certificate
     * verify_depth
     * ca_list
     * cipher_list

   ser acts as a server when it accepts a connection and as a client when
   it initiates a new connection by itself (it connects to something).

   Example 18. Short config file
[server:default]
method = TLSv1
verify_certificate = no
require_certificate = no
private_key = default_key.pem
certificate = default_cert.pem
ca_list = default_ca.pem

[client:default]
verify_certificate = yes
require_certificate = yes

#more relaxed for connection on the loopback interface
[server:127.0.0.1:5061]
method = SSLv23
verify_certificate = yes
require_certificate = no
private_key = local_key.pem
certificate = local_cert.pem
verify_depth = 3
ca_list = local_ca.pem

   For a more complete example check the tls.cfg distributed with the ser
   source (sip_router/modules/tls/tls.cfg).

   Example 19. Set config parameter
...
modparam("tls", "config", "/usr/local/etc/ser/tls.cfg")
...

   This module was put together by Jan Janak <jan@iptel.org> from code
   from the experimental tls core addon
   (http://cvs.berlios.de/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/ser/experimental/tls/),
   code originally written by Peter Griffiths and later maintained by
   Cesc Santasusana and from an iptelorg tls code addon, written by
   Andrei Pelinescu-Onciul <andrei@iptel.org>. Jan also added support for
   multiple domains, a tls specific config, config reloading and a tls
   specific select framework.

   The code is currently maintained by Andrei Pelinescu-Onciul
   <andrei@iptel.org>.
