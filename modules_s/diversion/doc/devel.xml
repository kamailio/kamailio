    <title>Developer's Guide</title>

    <para>
	According to the specification new Diversion header field should be
	inserted as the topmost Diversion header field in the message, that
	means before any other existing Diversion header field in the
	message. In addition to that, <function>add_diversion</function>
	function can be called several times and each time it should insert the
	new Diversion header field as the topmost one.
    </para>
    <para>
	In order to implement this, add_diversion function creates the anchor
	in data_lump lists as a static variable to ensure that the next call of
	the function will use the same anchor and would insert new Diversion
	headers before the one created in the previous execution. To my
	knowledge this is the only way of inserting the diversion header field
	before any other created in previous runs of the function.
    </para>
    <para>
	The anchor kept this way is only valid for a single message and we have
	to invalidate it when another message is being processed. For this
	reason, the function also stores the id of the message in another
	static variable and compares the value of that variable with the id of
	the SIP message being processed. If they differ then the anchor will be
	invalidated and the function creates a new one.
    </para>
    <para>
	The following code snippet shows the code that invalidates the anchor,
	new anchor will be created when the <varname>anchor</varname> variable
	is set to 0.
    </para>
    <programlisting>
static inline int add_diversion_helper(struct sip_msg* msg, str* s)
{
    static struct lump* anchor = 0;
    static int msg_id = 0;

    if (msg_id != msg->id) {
        msg_id = msg->id;
        anchor = 0;
    }
...
}
    </programlisting>
