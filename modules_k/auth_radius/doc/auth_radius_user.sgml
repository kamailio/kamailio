	<title>Overview</title>
	<para>
		This module contains functions that are used to perform authentication using a Radius
		server. Basically the proxy will pass along the credentials to the radius server which
		will in turn send a reply containing result of the authentication. So basically the
		whole authentication is done in the Radius server. Before sending the request to the
		radius server we perform some sanity checks over the credentials to make sure that only
		well formed credentials will get to the server. We have implemented radius
		authentication according to draft-sterman-aaa-sip-00. This module requires radiusclient-ng
		library version 0.5.0 or higher which is available from <ulink url='http://developer.berlios.de/projects/radiusclient-ng/'>
		http://developer.berlios.de/projects/radiusclient-ng/</ulink>.

	<title>Additional Credentials</title>
	<para>
		When performing authentification, the RADIUS server may include in the
		response additional credentials. This scheme is very useful in fetching
		additional user information from the RADIUS server without making
		extra queries.
	</para>
	<para>
		The additional credentials are embedded in the RADIUS reply as AVPs 
		<quote>SIP-AVP</quote>. The syntax of the value is:
		<itemizedlist>
			<listitem><para><emphasis>
			value = SIP_AVP_NAME SIP_AVP_VALUE
			</emphasis></para></listitem>
			<listitem><para><emphasis>
			SIP_AVP_NAME = STRING_NAME | '#'ID_NUMBER
			</emphasis></para></listitem>
			<listitem><para><emphasis>
			SIP_AVP_VALUE = ':'STRING_VALUE | '#'NUMBER_VALUE
			</emphasis></para></listitem>
		</itemizedlist>
	</para>
	<para>
		All additional credentials will be stored as &ser; AVPs
		(SIP_AVP_NAME = SIP_AVP_VALUE).
	</para>
	<para>
		The RPID value may be fetch via this mechanism.

	<section>
		<title><varname>radius_config</varname> (string)</title>
		<para>
		This is the location of the configuration file of radius client 
		libraries.
		</para>
		<para>
		Default value is 
			<quote>/usr/local/etc/radiusclient-ng/radiusclient.conf</quote>.
		</para>
		<example>
		<title><varname>radius_config</varname> parameter usage</title>
		<programlisting format="linespecific">
modparam("auth_radius", "radius_config", "/etc/radiusclient.conf")
		</programlisting>
		</example>
	</section>
	<section>
		<title><varname>service_type</varname> (integer)</title>
		<para>
		This is the value of the Service-Type radius attribute to be used. 
		The default should be fine for most people. See your radius client 
		include files for numbers to be put in this parameter if you need 
		to change it.
		</para>
		<para>
		Default value is <quote>15</quote>.
		</para>
		<example>
		<title><varname>service_type</varname> parameter usage</title>
		<programlisting format="linespecific">
modparam("auth_radius", "service_type", 15)

	<title>Exported Functions</title>
	<section>
		<title><function moreinfo="none">radius_www_authorize(realm)</function></title>
		<para>
		The function verifies credentials according to RFC2617. If the credentials are
		verified successfully then the function will succeed and mark the credentials as
		authorized (marked credentials can be later used by some other functions). If the
		function was unable to verify the credentials for some reason then it will fail and
		the script should call <function moreinfo="none">www_challenge</function> which will
		challenge the user again.
		</para>
		<para>
		This function will, in fact, perform sanity checks over the received credentials and
		then pass them along to the radius server which will verify the credentials and
		return whether they are valid or not.
		</para>
		<para>Meaning of the parameter is as follows:</para>
		<itemizedlist>
		<listitem>
			<para><emphasis>realm</emphasis> - Realm is a opaque string that the user agent
			should present to the user so he can decide what username and password to
			use. Usually this is domain of the host the server is running on.
			</para>
			<para>
			If an empty string <quote></quote> is used then the server will generate it
			from the request. In case of REGISTER requests To header field domain will
			be used (because this header field represents a user being registered), for
			all other messages From header field domain will be used.
			</para>
		</listitem>
		</itemizedlist>
		<example>
		<title><function moreinfo="none">radius_www_authorize</function> usage</title>
		<programlisting format="linespecific">
...
if (!radius_www_authorize("siphub.net")) {
	www_challenge("siphub.net", "1");
};
...
</programlisting>
