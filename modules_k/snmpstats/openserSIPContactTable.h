 * History:
 * --------
 * 2006-11-23 initial version (jmagder)
 * 2007-02-16 Moved all OID registrations from the experimental branch to 
 *            OpenSER's IANA assigned enterprise branch. (jmagder)
 * 
 * Note: this file was originally auto-generated by mib2c using
 * mib2c.array-user.conf
 *
 * This file contains the implementation of the openserSIPContact Table.  For a
 * full description of this structure, please see the OPENSER-SIP-SERVER-MIB.
 *
 * Some important notes on implementation follow:
 *
 * We require OpenSERs usrloc module to inform us when a contact is
 * added/removed.  The general callback process works as follows:
 *
 * 1) On startup, we register handleContactCallbacks() for USRLOC callbacks, so 
 *    we can be informed whenever a contact is added/removed from the system.  
 *    This registration happens with a call to registerForUSRLOCCallbacks().  
 *    (This is actually called when the SNMPStats module is initialized)
 *
 * 2) Whenever we receive a contact callback, handleContactCallbacks() will 
 *    quickly add the contact information and operation type to the
 *    interprocess buffer.  
 *
 * 3) When we receive an SNMP request for user/contact information, we consume
 *    the interprocess buffer with consumeInterprocessBuffer().  The function
 *    will add/delete rows to the tables, and then service the SNMP request.
 *
 * Notes: 
 *
 * - The interprocess buffer was necessary, because NetSNMP's containers can be
 *   very inefficient at adding large amounts of data at a time, such as when
 *   OpenSER first starts up.  It was decided its better to make an SNMP manager
 *   wait for data, instead of slowing down the rest of OpenSER while the
 *   sub-agent processes the data. 
 *
 * - It is important to send periodic SNMP requests to this table (or the user
 *   table), to make sure the process buffer doesn't get too large.
