 * History:
 * --------
 * 2006-11-23 initial version (jmagder)
 * 2007-02-16 Moved all OID registrations from the experimental branch to 
 *            OpenSER's IANA assigned enterprise branch. (jmagder)
 * 
 * Note: this file originally auto-generated by mib2c using
 * mib2c.array-user.conf
 *
 * The file implements the openserSIPStatusCodesTable.  For a full description
 * of the table, please see the OPENSER-SIP-COMMON-MIB.
 *
 * This file consists of many more functions than the other header files.  
 * This is because this table is writable, bringing a lot of SNMP overhead.
 *
 * Most of the contents are auto-generated (aside from white space and comment
 * changes), and can be ignored.  The functions that have been modified are:
 *
 * 1) openserSIPStatusCodesTable_create_row()
 *
 * 2) openserSIPStatusCodesTable_extract_index() 
 *
 * 3) openserSIPStatusCodesTable_can_[activate|deactivate|delete]()
 *   
 * 4) openserSIPStatusCodesTable_set_reserve1()
 *
 * 5) openserSIPStatusCodesTable_get_value()
 *
 * Full details can be found in openserSIPStatusCodesTable.c.  You can safely
 * ignore the other functions.

 * Specifically, the openserSIPStatusCodeIns and openserSIPStatusCodeOuts
 * variables don't store the total number of messages sent or received from the
 * system at the time of a SNMP GET request.  Instead, they store the number of
 * messages in or out (with respect to the message code specified by
 * openserSIPStatusCodeValue) at the time of the rows *creation*. 
 *
 * When the get request is received, the statistics framework will be queried,
 * and these values subtracted from that query.  This effectively gives us how
 * many of the given message codes have occured since the creation of the row,
 * insead of since OpenSER first loaded up.
