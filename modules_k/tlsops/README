Chapter 1. Admin Guide

1.1. Overview

   This module implements TLS related functions to use in the
   routing script, and exports pseudo variables with certificate
   and TLS parameters.

1.2. Dependencies

1.2.1. Kamailio core

   Kamailio must be compiled with TLS=1.

1.2.2. External Libraries or Applications

   The following libraries or applications must be installed
   before running Kamailio with this module loaded:
     * openssl (libssl).

1.3. Exported Parameters

   None!

1.4. Exported Functions

1.4.1.  is_peer_verified

   Returns 1 if the message is received via TLS and the peer was
   verified during TLS connection handshake, otherwise it returns
   -1

   This function can be used from REQUEST_ROUTE.

   Example 1.1. is_peer_verified usage
...
if (is_peer_verified()) {
        xlog("L_INFO","request from verified TLS peer\n");
} else {
        xlog("L_INFO","request not verified\n");
}
...

1.5. Pseudo-Variables

   This module exports the follong pseudo-variables:

   certificate and the local certificate. Further, some parameters
   can be read from the "Subject" field or the "Issuer" field.

   If you want to debug TLS connections, put the following log
   statements into your Kamailio.cfg. This will dump all available
   TLS pseudo variables.

Chapter 2. Frequently Asked Questions

   2.1.

       What is the difference between the TLS directory and the TLSOPS
       module directory?

       The code in the TLS directory implements the TLS transport
       layer. The TLSOPS module implements TLS related functions which
       can be used in the routing script.

   2.2.

       Where can I find more about Kamailio?

       Take a look at http://www.kamailio.org/.

   2.3.

       Where can I post a question about this module?

       First at all check if your question was already answered on one
       of our mailing lists:
         * User Mailing List -
           http://lists.kamailio.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/users
         * Developer Mailing List -
           http://lists.kamailio.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/devel

       E-mails regarding any stable Kamailio release should be sent to
       <users@lists.kamailio.org> and e-mails regarding development
       versions should be sent to <devel@lists.kamailio.org>.

       If you want to keep the mail private, send it to
