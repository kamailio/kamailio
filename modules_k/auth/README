1. Overview

   This is a module that provides common functions that are needed by
   other authentication related modules. Also, it can perform
   authentication taking username and password from pseudo-variables.

2. Nonce Security

   The authentication mechanism offers protection against sniffing
   intrusion. The module generates and verifies the nonces so that they
   can be used only once (in an auth response). This is done by having a
   lifetime value and an index associated with every nonce. Using only an
   expiration value is not good enough because,as this value has to be of
   few tens of seconds, it is possible for someone to sniff on the
   network, get the credentials and then reuse them in another packet with
   which to register a different contact or make calls using the others's
   account. The index ensures that this will never be possible since it is
   generated as unique through the lifetime of the nonce.

   The default limit for the requests that can be authenticated is 100000
   in 30 seconds. If you wish to adjust this you can decrease the lifetime
   of a nonce( how much time to wait for a reply to a challenge). However,
   be aware not to set it to a too small value.

3. Dependencies

   3.1. Kamailio Modules
   3.2. External Libraries or Applications

3.1. Kamailio Modules

   The module depends on the following modules (in the other words the
   listed modules must be loaded before this module):
     * sl -- Stateless replies
       pv -- Pseudo-variables

3.2. External Libraries or Applications

   The following libraries or applications must be installed before
   running Kamailio with this module loaded:
     * none

4. Exported Parameters

   4.1. secret (string)
   4.2. nonce_expire (integer)
   4.3. realm_prefix (string)
   4.4. username_spec (string)
   4.5. password_spec (string)
   4.6. calculate_ha1 (integer)
   4.7. nonce_reuse (integer)

4.1. secret (string)

   Secret phrase used to calculate the nonce value.

   The default is to use a random value generated from the random source
   in the core.

   If you use multiple servers in your installation, and would like to
   authenticate on the second server against the nonce generated at the
   first one its necessary to explicitly set the secret to the same value
   on all servers. However, the use of a shared (and fixed) secret as
   nonce is insecure, much better is to stay with the default. Any clients
   should send the reply to the server that issued the request.

   Example 1.1. secret parameter example
modparam("auth", "secret", "johndoessecretphrase")

4.2. nonce_expire (integer)

   Nonces have limited lifetime. After a given period of time nonces will
   be considered invalid. This is to protect replay attacks. Credentials
   containing a stale nonce will be not authorized, but the user agent
   will be challenged again. This time the challenge will contain stale
   parameter which will indicate to the client that it doesn't have to
   disturb user by asking for username and password, it can recalculate
   credentials using existing username and password.

   The value is in seconds and default value is 30 seconds.

   Example 1.2. nonce_expire parameter example
modparam("auth", "nonce_expire", 15)   # Set nonce_expire to 15s

4.3. realm_prefix (string)

   Prefix to be automatically strip from realm. As an alternative to SRV
   records (not all SIP clients support SRV lookup), a subdomain of the
   master domain can be defined for SIP purposes (like sip.mydomain.net
   pointing to same IP address as the SRV record for mydomain.net). By
   ignoring the realm_prefix “sip.”, at authentication, sip.mydomain.net
   will be equivalent to mydomain.net .

   Default value is empty string.

   Example 1.3. realm_prefix parameter example
modparam("auth", "realm_prefix", "sip.")

4.4. username_spec (string)

   This name of the pseudo-variable that will hold the username.

   Default value is “NULL”.

   Example 1.4. username_spec parameter usage
modparam("auth", "username_spec", "$var(username)")

4.5. password_spec (string)

   This name of the pseudo-variable that will hold the password.

   Default value is “NULL”.

   Example 1.5. password_spec parameter usage
modparam("auth", "password_spec", "$avp(s:password)")

4.6. calculate_ha1 (integer)

   This parameter tells the server whether it should expect plaintext
   passwords in the pseudo-variable or a pre-calculated HA1 string.

   If the parameter is set to 1 then the server will assume that the
   “password_spec” pseudo-variable contains plaintext passwords and it
   will calculate HA1 strings on the fly. If the parameter is set to 0
   then the server assumes the pseudo-variable contains the HA1 strings
   directly and will not calculate them.

   Default value of this parameter is 0.

   Example 1.6. calculate_ha1 parameter usage
modparam("auth", "calculate_ha1", 1)

4.7. nonce_reuse (integer)

   Since version 1.4.0, the module checks if the nonce value is re-used,
   enhancing security protection against reply and man in the middle
   attacks. This check is done by default.

   If the parameter is set to 1 then the nonce reuse checking is disabled,
   offering compatibility with previous behavior. Not recommended though,
   this functionality is still good in some scenarios, specially when
   registration time is very low to deal with NAT traversal.

   Default value of this parameter is 0 (protect against nonce reuse).

   Example 1.7. nonce_reuse parameter usage
modparam("auth", "nonce_reuse", 1)

5. Exported Functions

   5.1. www_challenge(realm, qop)
   5.2. proxy_challenge(realm, qop)
   5.3. consume_credentials()
   5.4. pv_www_authorize(realm)
   5.5. pv_proxy_authorize(realm)

5.1.  www_challenge(realm, qop)

   The function challenges a user agent. It will generate a WWW-Authorize
   header field containing a digest challenge, it will put the header
   field into a response generated from the request the server is
   processing and send the reply. Upon reception of such a reply the user
   agent should compute credentials and retry the request. For more
   information regarding digest authentication see RFC2617.

   In case the reply cannot be sent, this method returns "-1"; in case a
   reply was sent, it just terminates further script processing.

   Meaning of the parameters is as follows:
     * realm - Realm is a opaque string that the user agent should present
       to the user so he can decide what username and password to use.
       Usually this is domain of the host the server is running on.
       If an empty string “” is used then the server will generate it from
       the request. In case of REGISTER requests To header field domain
       will be used (because this header field represents a user being
       registered), for all other messages From header field domain will
       be used.
       The string may contain pseudo variables.
     * qop - Value of this parameter can be either “1” or “0”. When set to
       1 then the server will put a qop parameter in the challenge. When
       set to 0 then the server will not put the qop parameter in the
       challenge. It is recommended to use the qop parameter, however
       there are still some user agents that cannot handle qop properly so
       we made this optional. On the other hand there are still some user
       agents that cannot handle request without a qop parameter too.
       Enabling this parameter don't improve the security at the moment,
       because the sequence number is not stored and therefore could not
       be checked. Actually there is no information kept by the module
       during the challenge and response requests.

   This function can be used from REQUEST_ROUTE.

   Example 1.8. www_challenge usage
...
if (!www_authorize("siphub.net", "subscriber")) {
        www_challenge("siphub.net", "1");
};
...

5.2.  proxy_challenge(realm, qop)

   The function challenges a user agent. It will generate a
   Proxy-Authorize header field containing a digest challenge, it will put
   the header field into a response generated from the request the server
   is processing and send the reply. Upon reception of such a reply the
   user agent should compute credentials and retry the request. For more
   information regarding digest authentication see RFC2617.

   In case the reply cannot be sent, this method returns "-1"; in case a
   reply was sent, it just terminates further script processing.

   Meaning of the parameters is as follows:
     * realm - Realm is a opaque string that the user agent should present
       to the user so he can decide what username and password to use.
       Usually this is domain of the host the server is running on.
       If an empty string “” is used then the server will generate it from
       the request. From header field domain will be used as realm.
       The string may contain pseudo variables.
     * qop - Value of this parameter can be either “1” or “0”. When set to
       1 then the server will put a qop parameter in the challenge. When
       set to 0 then the server will not put the qop parameter in the
       challenge. It is recommended to use the qop parameter, however
       there are still some user agents that cannot handle qop properly so
       we made this optional. On the other hand there are still some user
       agents that cannot handle request without a qop parameter too.
       Enabling this parameter don't improve the security at the moment,
       because the sequence number is not stored and therefore could not
       be checked. Actually there is no information kept by the module
       during the challenge and response requests.

   This function can be used from REQUEST_ROUTE.

   Example 1.9. proxy_challenge usage
...
if (!proxy_authorize("", "subscriber)) {
        proxy_challenge("", "1");  # Realm will be autogenerated
};
...

5.3.  consume_credentials()

   This function removes previously authorized credentials from the
   message being processed by the server. That means that the downstream
   message will not contain credentials there were used by this server.
   This ensures that the proxy will not reveal information about
   credentials used to downstream elements and also the message will be a
   little bit shorter. The function must be called after www_authorize or
   proxy_authorize.

   This function can be used from REQUEST_ROUTE.

   Example 1.10. consume_credentials example
...
if (www_authorize("", "subscriber)) {
    consume_credentials();
};
...

5.4.  pv_www_authorize(realm)

   The function verifies credentials according to RFC2617. If the
   credentials are verified successfully then the function will succeed
   and mark the credentials as authorized (marked credentials can be later
   used by some other functions). If the function was unable to verify the
   credentials for some reason then it will fail and the script should
   call www_challenge which will challenge the user again.

   Negative codes may be interpreted as follows:
     * -5 (generic error) - some generic error occurred and no reply was
       sent out;
     * -4 (no credentials) - credentials were not found in request;
     * -3 (stale nonce) - stale nonce;
     * -2 (invalid password) - valid user, but wrong password;
     * -1 (invalid user) - authentication user does not exist.

   Meaning of the parameters is as follows:
     * realm - Realm is a opaque string that the user agent should present
       to the user so he can decide what username and password to use.
       Usually this is domain of the host the server is running on.
       If an empty string “” is used then the server will generate it from
       the request. In case of REGISTER requests To header field domain
       will be used (because this header field represents a user being
       registered), for all other messages From header field domain will
       be used.
       The string may contain pseudo variables.

   This function can be used from REQUEST_ROUTE.

   Example 1.11. pv_www_authorize usage
...
$var(username)="abc";
$avp(s:password)="xyz";
if (!pv_www_authorize("kamailio.org")) {
        www_challenge("kamailio.org", "1");
};
...

5.5.  pv_proxy_authorize(realm)

   The function verifies credentials according to RFC2617. If the
   credentials are verified successfully then the function will succeed
   and mark the credentials as authorized (marked credentials can be later
   used by some other functions). If the function was unable to verify the
   credentials for some reason then it will fail and the script should
   call proxy_challenge which will challenge the user again. For more
   about the negative return codes, see the above function.

   Meaning of the parameters is as follows:
     * realm - Realm is a opaque string that the user agent should present
       to the user so he can decide what username and password to use.
       Usually this is domain of the host the server is running on.
       If an empty string “” is used then the server will generate it from
       the request. From header field domain will be used as realm.
       The string may contain pseudo variables.

   This function can be used from REQUEST_ROUTE.

   Example 1.12. pv_proxy_authorize usage
...
$var(username)="abc";
$avp(s:password)="xyz";
if (!pv_proxy_authorize("")) {
        proxy_challenge("", "1");  # Realm will be autogenerated
};
...
