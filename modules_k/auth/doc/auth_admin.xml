	<title>Overview</title>
	<para>
		This is a module that provides common functions that are needed by
		other authentication related modules. Also, it can perform 
		authentication taking username and password from pseudo-variables.
    </para>
	</section>

    <section>
		<title>Nonce Security</title>
    <para>
		The authentication mechanism offers protection against sniffing intrusion.
		The module generates and verifies the nonces so that they can be used only
		once (in an auth response). This is done
		by having a lifetime value and an index associated with every nonce.
		Using only an expiration value is not good enough because,as this value
		has to be of few tens of seconds, it is possible for someone to sniff
		on the network, get the credentials and then reuse them in another packet
		with which to register a different contact or make calls using the others's
		account. The index ensures that this will never be possible since it
		is generated as unique through the lifetime of the nonce.
	</para>
	<para>
		The default limit for the requests that can be authenticated is 100000 
		in 30 seconds.
		If you wish to adjust this you can decrease the lifetime of a nonce(
		how much time to wait for a reply to a challenge). However, be aware not to
		set it to a too small value.
    </para>

	<title>Exported Parameters</title>
	<section>
		<title><varname>secret</varname> (string)</title>
		<para>
		Secret phrase used to calculate the nonce value.
		</para>
		<para>
		The default is to use a random value generated from the random source in the core.
		</para>
		<para>
		If you use multiple servers in your installation, and would like to authenticate
		on the second server against the nonce generated at the first one its necessary
		to explicitly set the secret to the same value on all servers. 
		However, the use of a shared (and fixed) secret as nonce is insecure, much better
		is to stay with the default. Any clients should send the reply to the server that
		issued the request.
		</para>
		<example>
		<title>secret parameter example</title>
		<programlisting format="linespecific">
modparam("auth", "secret", "johndoessecretphrase")
</programlisting>
		</example>
	</section>
	<section>
		<title><varname>nonce_expire</varname> (integer)</title>
		<para>
		Nonces have limited lifetime. After a given period of time nonces 
		will be considered invalid. This is to protect replay attacks. 
		Credentials containing a stale nonce will be not authorized, but the 
		user agent will be challenged again. This time the challenge will 
		contain <varname>stale</varname> parameter which will indicate to the
		client that it doesn't have to disturb user by asking for username 
		and password, it can recalculate credentials using existing username 
		and password.
		</para>
		<para>
		The value is in seconds and default value is 30 seconds.
		</para>
		<example>
		<title>nonce_expire parameter example</title>
		<programlisting format="linespecific">
modparam("auth", "nonce_expire", 15)   # Set nonce_expire to 15s
</programlisting>
		</example>
	</section>
	<section>
		<title><varname>realm_prefix</varname> (string)</title>
		<para>
			Prefix to be automatically strip from realm. As an alternative to
			SRV records (not all SIP clients support SRV lookup), a subdomain
			of the master domain can be defined for SIP purposes (like 
			sip.mydomain.net pointing to same IP address as the SRV
			record for mydomain.net). By ignoring the realm_prefix 
			<quote>sip.</quote>, at authentication, sip.mydomain.net will be
			equivalent to mydomain.net .
		</para>
		<para>
		Default value is empty string.
		</para>

	<section>
		<title><varname>username_spec</varname> (string)</title>
		<para>
		This name of the pseudo-variable that will hold the username.
		</para>
		<para>
		Default value is <quote>NULL</quote>.
		</para>

	<section>
		<title><varname>password_spec</varname> (string)</title>
		<para>
		This name of the pseudo-variable that will hold the password.
		</para>
		<para>
		Default value is <quote>NULL</quote>.
		</para>

	</section>

	<section>
		<title><varname>calculate_ha1</varname> (integer)</title>
		<para>
		This parameter tells the server whether it should expect plaintext
		passwords in the pseudo-variable or a pre-calculated HA1 string.
		</para>
		<para>
		If the parameter is set to 1 then the server will assume that the
		<quote>password_spec</quote> pseudo-variable contains plaintext passwords
		and it will calculate HA1 strings on the fly. If the parameter is set to 0
		then the server assumes the pseudo-variable contains the HA1 strings directly
		and will not calculate them.
		</para>
		<para>
		Default value of this parameter is 0.
		</para>
		<example>

	<section>
		<title><varname>nonce_reuse</varname> (integer)</title>
		<para>
		Since version 1.4.0, the module checks if the nonce value
		is re-used, enhancing security protection against reply and
		man in the middle attacks. This check is done by default.
		</para>
		<para>
		If the parameter is set to 1 then the nonce reuse checking is disabled,
		offering compatibility with previous behavior. Not recommended though, this
		functionality is still good in some scenarios, specially when registration time
		is very low to deal with NAT traversal.
		</para>
		<para>
		Default value of this parameter is 0 (protect against nonce reuse).
		</para>

	<title>Exported Functions</title>
	<section>
		<title>
			<function moreinfo="none">www_challenge(realm, qop)</function>
		</title>
		<para>
		The function challenges a user agent. It will generate a 
		WWW-Authorize header field containing a digest challenge, it will 
		put the header field into a response generated from the request the 
		server is processing and send the reply. Upon reception of such a 
		reply the user agent should compute credentials and retry the
		request. For more information regarding digest authentication 
		see RFC2617.
		</para>
		<para>
		In case the reply cannot be sent, this method returns "-1"; in case a
		reply was sent, it just terminates further script processing.
		</para>
		<para>Meaning of the parameters is as follows:</para>
		<itemizedlist>
		<listitem>
			<para><emphasis>realm</emphasis> - Realm is a opaque string that 
			the user agent should present to the user so he can decide what 
			username and password to use. Usually this is domain of the host 
			the server is running on.
			</para>
			<para>
			If an empty string <quote></quote> is used then the server will 
			generate it from the request. In case of REGISTER requests To 
			header field domain will be used (because this header field 
			represents a user being registered), for all other messages From 
			header field domain will be used.
			</para>
			<para>
			The string may contain pseudo variables.
			</para>
		</listitem>
		<listitem>
			<para><emphasis>qop</emphasis> - Value of this parameter can be 
			either <quote>1</quote> or <quote>0</quote>. When set to 1 then 
			the server will put a qop parameter in the challenge. When set to 0
			then the server will not put the qop parameter in the challenge. It
			is recommended to use the qop parameter, however there are still some
			user agents that cannot handle qop properly so we made this optional.
			On the other hand there are still some user agents that cannot handle
			request without a qop parameter too.
			</para>
			<para>Enabling this parameter don't improve the security at the moment,
			because the sequence number is not stored and therefore could not be
			checked. Actually there is no information kept by the module during
			the challenge and response requests.
			</para>
		</listitem>
		</itemizedlist>
		<para>
		This function can be used from REQUEST_ROUTE.
		</para>

	<section>
		<title>
			<function moreinfo="none">consume_credentials()</function>
		</title>
		<para>
		This function removes previously authorized credentials from the 
		message being processed by the server. That means that the downstream 
		message will not contain credentials there were used by this server. 
		This ensures that the proxy will not reveal information about 
		credentials used to downstream elements and also the message will be 
		a little bit shorter. The function must be called after 
		<function moreinfo="none">www_authorize</function> or 
		<function moreinfo="none">proxy_authorize</function>.

		<para>
		The function verifies credentials according to

		credentials are verified successfully then the function will succeed 
		and mark the credentials as authorized (marked credentials can be later 
		used by some other functions). If the function was unable to verify the 
		credentials for some reason then it will fail and the script should 
		call <function moreinfo="none">www_challenge</function> which will
