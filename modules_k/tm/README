Chapter 1. Admin Guide

1.1. Overview

   TM module enables stateful processing of SIP transactions. The
   main use of stateful logic, which is costly in terms of memory
   and CPU, is some services inherently need state. For example,
   transaction-based accounting (module acc) needs to process
   transaction state as opposed to individual messages, and any
   kinds of forking must be implemented statefully. Other use of
   stateful processing is it trading CPU caused by retransmission
   processing for memory. That makes however only sense if CPU
   consumption per request is huge. For example, if you want to
   avoid costly DNS resolution for every retransmission of a
   request to an unresolvable destination, use stateful mode.
   Then, only the initial message burdens server by DNS queries,
   subsequent retransmissions will be dropped and will not result
   in more processes blocked by DNS resolution. The price is more
   memory consumption and higher processing latency.

   From user's perspective, the major function is t_relay(). It
   setup transaction state, absorb retransmissions from upstream,
   generate downstream retransmissions and correlate replies to
   requests.

   In general, if TM is used, it copies clones of received SIP
   messages in shared memory. That costs the memory and also CPU
   time (memcpys, lookups, shmem locks, etc.) Note that non-TM
   functions operate over the received message in private memory,
   that means that any core operations will have no effect on
   statefully processed messages after creating the transactional
   state. For example, calling record_route after t_relay is
   pretty useless, as the RR is added to privately held message
   whereas its TM clone is being forwarded.

   TM is quite big and uneasy to program--lot of mutexes, shared
   memory access, malloc and free, timers--you really need to be
   careful when you do anything. To simplify TM programming,
   there is the instrument of callbacks. The callback mechanisms
   allow programmers to register their functions to specific
   event. See t_hooks.h for a list of possible events.

   Other things programmers may want to know is UAC--it is a very
   simplistic code which allows you to generate your own
   transactions. Particularly useful for things like NOTIFYs or
   IM gateways. The UAC takes care of all the transaction
   machinery: retransmissions , FR timeouts, forking, etc. See
   t_uac prototype in uac.h for more details. Who wants to see
   the transaction result may register for a callback.

1.1.1. Per-Branch flags

   First what is the idea with the branch concept: branch route
   is a route to be execute separately for each branch before
   being sent out - changes in that route should reflect only on
   that branch.

   There are several types of flags in OpenSER :
     * message/transaction flags - they are visible everywhere in
       the transaction (in all routes and in all sequential
       replies/request).
     * branch flags - flags that are visible only from a specific
       branch - in all replies and routes connected to this
       branch.
       script flags - flags that exist only during script
       execution. They are not store anywhere and are lost once
       the top level route was left.

   For example: I have a call parallel forking to GW and to a
   user. And I would like to know from which branch I will get
   the final negative reply (if so). I will set a branch route
   before relaying the calls (with the 2 branches). The branch
   route will be separately executed for each branch; in the
   branch going to GW (I can identified it by looking to RURI), I
   will set a branch flag. This flag will appear only in the
   onreply route run for replied from GW. It will be also be
   visible in failure route if the final elected reply belongs to
   the GW branch. This flags will not be visible in the other
   branch (in routes executing replies from the other branch).

   For how to define branch flags and use via script, see
   Section 1.4.15, " t_on_branch(branch_route) " and the
   setbflag(), resetbflag() and isbflagset() script functions.

   Also, modules may set branch flags before transaction creation
   (for the moment this feature is not available in script). The
   REGISTRAR module was the first to use this type of flags. The
   NAT flag is pushed in branch flags instead in message flags

1.1.2. Timer-Based Failover

   Timers can be used to trigger failover behavior. E.g. if we
   send a call a gateway and the gateway does not send a
   provisional response within 3 seconds, we want to cancel this
   call and send the call to another gateway. Another example is
   to ring a SIP client only for 30 seconds and then redirect the
   call to the voicemail.

   There are two timers in OpenSER :
     * fr_timer - this timer is used when no response was
       received yet. If there is no response after fr_timer
       seconds the timer triggers (and failure route will be
       executed if t_on_failure() was called). If a provisional
       response was received, the timer is set to fr_inv_timer
       for INVITE transactions, and RT_T2 for all other
       transactions. If a final reponse is received, the
       transaction has finished.
     * fr_inv_timer - this timer is used when a provisional
       reponse was received for an INVITE transaction.

   For example: You want to have failover if there is no
   provisional response after 3 seconds, but you want to ring for
   60 seconds. Thuse, set the fr_timer to 3 and fr_inv_timer to
   60.

1.1.3. DNS Failover

   DNS based failover can be use when relaying stateful requests.
   According to RFC 3263, DNS failover should be done on
   transport level or transaction level. TM module supports them
   both.

   Failover at transport level may be triggered by a failure of
   sending out the request message. A failure occures if the
   coresponding interface was found for sending the request, if
   the TCP connection was refused or if a generic internal error
   happend during send. There is no ICMP error report support.

   Failover at transaction level may be triggered when the
   transaction completed either with a 503 reply, either with a
   timeout without any received reply. In such a case,
   automatically, a new branch will be forked if any other
   destination IPs can be used to deliver the requests. The new
   branch will be a clone of the winning branch.

   The set of destinations IPs is step-by-step build (on demand)
   based on the NAPTR, SRV and A records available for the
   destination domain.

   DNS-based failover is by default applied excepting when this
   failover is globally disabled (see the core parameter
   disable_dns_failover) or when the relay flag (per transaction)
   is set (see the t_relay() function).

1.2. Dependencies

1.2.1. OpenSER Modules

   The following modules must be loaded before this module:
     * No dependencies on other OpenSER modules.

1.2.2. External Libraries or Applications

   The following libraries or applications must be installed
   before running OpenSER with this module loaded:
     * None.

1.3. Exported Parameters

1.3.1. fr_timer (integer)

   Timer which hits if no final reply for a request or ACK for a
   negative INVITE reply arrives (in seconds).

   Default value is 30 seconds. 

   Example 1.1. Set fr_timer parameter
...
modparam("tm", "fr_timer", 10)
...

1.3.2. fr_inv_timer (integer)

   Timer which hits if no final reply for an INVITE arrives after
   a provisional message was received (in seconds). This timer is
   started after the first provisional response. Thus, fast
   failover (no 100 trying from gateway) can be achieved by
   setting fr_timer to low values. See example below

   Default value is 120 seconds. 

   Example 1.2. Set fr_inv_timer parameter
...
modparam("tm", "fr_inv_timer", 200)
...

1.3.3. wt_timer (integer)

   Time for which a transaction stays in memory to absorb delayed
   messages after it completed; also, when this timer hits,
   retransmission of local cancels is stopped (a puristic but
   complex behavior would be not to enter wait state until local
   branches are finished by a final reply or FR timer--we
   simplified).

   For non-INVITE transaction this timer relates to timer J of
   RFC 3261 section 17.2.2. According to the RFC this timer
   should be 64*T1 (= 32 seconds). But this would increase memory
   usage as the transactions are kept in memory very long.

   Default value is 5 seconds. 

   Example 1.3. Set wt_timer parameter
...
modparam("tm", "wt_timer", 10)
...

1.3.4. delete_timer (integer)

   Time after which a to-be-deleted transaction currently ref-ed
   by a process will be tried to be deleted again.

   Default value is 2 seconds. 

   Example 1.4. Set delete_timer parameter
...
modparam("tm", "delete_timer", 5)
...

1.3.5. T1_timer (integer)

   Retransmission T1 period, in milliseconds.

   Default value is 500 milliseconds. 

   Example 1.5. Set T1_timer parameter
...
modparam("tm", "T1_timer", 700)
...

1.3.6. T2_timer (integer)

   Maximum retransmission period, in milliseconds.

   Default value is 4000 milliseconds. 

   Example 1.6. Set T2_timer parameter
...
modparam("tm", "T2_timer", 8000)
...

1.3.7. ruri_matching (integer)

   Should be request-uri matching used as a part of pre-3261
   transaction matching as the standard wants us to do so? Turn
   only off for better interaction with devices that are broken
   and send different r-uri in CANCEL/ACK than in original
   INVITE.

   Default value is 1 (true). 

   Example 1.7. Set ruri_matching parameter
...
modparam("tm", "ruri_matching", 0)
...

1.3.8. via1_matching (integer)

   Should be top most VIA matching used as a part of pre-3261
   transaction matching as the standard wants us to do so? Turn
   only off for better interaction with devices that are broken
   and send different top most VIA in CANCEL/ACK than in original
   INVITE.

   Default value is 1 (true). 

   Example 1.8. Set via1_matching parameter
...
modparam("tm", "via1_matching", 0)
...

1.3.9. unix_tx_timeout (integer)

   Send timeout to be used by function which use UNIX sockets (as
   t_write_unix).

   Default value is 2 seconds. 

   Example 1.9. Set unix_tx_timeout parameter
...
modparam("tm", "unix_tx_timeout", 5)
...

1.3.10. restart_fr_on_each_reply (integer)

   If true (non null value), the final response timer will be
   re-triggered for each received provisional reply. In this
   case, final response timeout may occure after a time longe
   than fr_inv_timer (if UAS keeps sending provisional replies)

   Default value is 1 (true). 

   Example 1.10. Set restart_fr_on_each_reply parameter
...
modparam("tm", "restart_fr_on_each_reply", 0)
...

1.3.11. fr_timer_avp (string)

   Full specification (NAME, ID, Alias) of an AVP which contains
   a final response timeout value. If present, ths value will
   override the static fr_timer parameter.

   If set to empty string, the whole mechanism for variable
   timeout will be disabled, falling back to the static value.

   Default value is "NULL" (feature disabled). 

   Example 1.11. Set fr_timer_avp parameter
...
modparam("tm", "fr_timer_avp", "$avp(i:24)")
...

1.3.12. fr_inv_timer_avp (string)

   Full specification (NAME, ID, Alias) of an AVP which contains
   a final INVITE response timeout value. If present, ths value
   will overeide the static fr_inv_timer parameter.

   If set to empty string, the whole mechanism for variable
   timeout will be disabled, falling back to the static value.

   Default value is "NULL" (feature disabled). 

   Example 1.12. Set fr_inv_timer_avp parameter
...
modparam("tm", "fr_inv_timer_avp", "$avp(i:25)")
...

1.3.13. tw_append (string)

   List of additional information to be appended by t_write_fifo
   and t_write_unix functions.

   Default value is null string. 

   Syntax of the parameter is:
     * tw_append = append_name':' element (';'element)* 
     * element = ( [name '='] pseudo_variable) 

   The full list of supported pseudo-variables in OpenSER is
   availabe at:
   http://openser.org/docs/pseudo-variables-1.1.x.html

   Each element will be appended per line in "name: value"
   format. Element "$rb (message body)" is the only one which
   does not accept name; the body it will be printed all the time
   at the end, disregarding its position in the definition
   string.

   Example 1.13. Set tw_append parameter
...
modparam("tm", "tw_append",
   "test: ua=$hdr(User-Agent) ;avp=$avp(i:10);$rb;time=$Ts")
...

1.3.14. pass_provisional_replies (integer)

   Enable/disable passing of provisional replies to FIFO
   applications.

   Default value is 0. 

   Example 1.14. Set pass_provisional_replies parameter
...
modparam("tm", "pass_provisional_replies", 1)
...

1.3.15. syn_branch (integer)

   Enable/disable the usage of stateful synonym branch IDs in the
   generated Via headers. They are faster but not reboot-safe.

   Default value is 1 (use synonym branches). 

   Example 1.15. Set syn_branch parameter
...
modparam("tm", "syn_branch", 0)
...

1.3.16. onreply_avp_mode (integer)

   Describes how the AVPs should be handled in reply route:
     * 0 - the AVPs will be per message only; they will not
       interfere with the AVPS stored in transaction; initially
       there will be an empty list and at the end of the route,
       all AVPs that were created will be discarded.
     * 1 - the AVPs will be the transaction AVPs; initially the
       transaction AVPs will be visible; at the end of the route,
       the list will attached back to transaction (with all the
       changes)

   In mode 1, you can see the AVPs you set in request route,
   branch route or failure route. The side efect is performance
   as more locking is required in order to keep the AVP's list
   integrity.

   Default value is 0. 

   Example 1.16. Set onreply_avp_mode parameter
...
modparam("tm", "onreply_avp_mode", 1)
...

1.4. Exported Functions

1.4.1.  t_newtran()

   Creates a new transaction, returns a negative value on error.
   This is the only way a script can add a new transaction in an
   atomic way. Typically, it is used to deploy a UAS.

Warning

   NOTE that the changes on the request that are made after this
   function call will not be saved into transaction!!!

   This function can be used from REQUEST_ROUTE.

   Example 1.17. t_newtran usage
...
if (t_newtran()) {
        log("UAS logic");
        t_reply("999","hello");
} else sl_reply_error();
...

1.4.2.  t_relay([flags])

   Relay a message statefully to destination indicated in current
   URI. (If the original URI was rewritten by UsrLoc, RR,
   strip/prefix, etc., the new URI will be taken). Returns a
   negative value on failure--you may still want to send a
   negative reply upstream statelessly not to leave upstream UAC
   in lurch.

   The coresponding transaction may or may not be already
   created. If not yet created, the function will automatically
   create it.

   The function may take as parameter an optional set of flags
   for controlling the internal behaviour. The flags may be given
   in decimal or hexa format; supported flags are:
     * 0x01 - do not generate an 100 trying provisional reply
       when building the transaction. By default one is
       generated. Useful if you already pushed an stateless 100
       reply from script.
     * 0x02 - do not internally send a negative reply in case of
       failure. It applies only when the transaction is created.
       By default one is sent. Useful if you want to implement a
       serial forking in case of failure.
     * 0x04 - disable the DNS failover for the transaction. Only
       first IP will be used. It disable the failover both at
       transaport and transaction level.

   In case of error, the function returns the following codes:
     * -1 - generic internal error
     * -2 - bad message (parsing errors)
     * -3 - no destination available (no branches were added or
       request already cancelled)
     * -4 - bad destination (unresolvable address)
     * -5 - destination filtered (black listed)
     * -6 - generic send failed

   This function can be used from REQUEST_ROUTE, FAILURE_ROUTE.

   Example 1.18. t_relay usage
...
if (!t_relay()) {
    sl_reply_error();
    exit;
}
...

1.4.3.  t_relay(proto:host:port,[flags])

   Relay a message statefully to a fixed destination. The
   destination is specified as "[proto:]host[:port]".

   The function may take as parameter an optional set of flags
   for controlling the internal behaviour - for details see the
   above "t_relay([flags])" function.

   This functions can be used from REQUEST_ROUTE, FAILURE_ROUTE.

   Example 1.19. t_relay usage
...
t_relay("tcp:192.168.1.10:5060");
t_relay("mydomain.com:5070","0x1");
t_relay("udp:mydomain.com");
...

1.4.4.  t_reply(code, reason_phrase)

   Sends a stateful reply after a transaction has been
   established. See t_newtran for usage.

   Meaning of the parameters is as follows:
     * code - Reply code number.
     * reason_phrase - Reason string.

   This function can be used from REQUEST_ROUTE, FAILURE_ROUTE.

   Example 1.20. t_reply usage
...
t_reply("404", "Not found");
...

1.4.5.  t_replicate(URI,[flags])

   Replicates a request to another destination. No information
   due the replicated request (like reply code) will be forwarded
   to the original SIP UAC.

   The destination is specified by a SIP URI. If multiple
   destinations are to be used, the additional SIP URIs have to
   be set as branches.

   The function may take as parameter an optional set of flags
   for controlling the internal behaviour - for description see
   the above "t_relay([flags])" function. Note that only 0x4 is
   applicable here.

   This functions can be used from REQUEST_ROUTE.

1.4.7.  t_check_status(re)

   Returns true if the regualr expresion "re" match the reply
   code of the response message as follows:
     * in routing block - the code of the last sent reply.
     * in on_reply block - the code of the current received
       reply.
     * in on_failure block - the code of the selected negative
       final reply.

   This function can be used from REQUEST_ROUTE, ONREPLY_ROUTE,
   FAILURE_ROUTE and BRANCH_ROUTE .

   Example 1.23. t_check_status usage

    log("487 or 408 negative reply\n");
}
...

1.4.8.  t_flush_flags()

   Flush the flags from current request into the already created
   transaction. It make sens only in routing block if the

   This function can be used from REQUEST_ROUTE and BRANCH_ROUTE
   .

   Example 1.24. t_flush_flags usage
...
t_flush_flags();
...

1.4.9.  t_local_replied(reply)

   Returns true if all or last (depending of the parameter)
   reply(es) were local generated (and not received).

   Parameter may be "all" or "last".

   This function can be used from REQUEST_ROUTE, BRANCH_ROUTE,

1.4.11.  t_check_trans()

   Returns true if the current request is associated to a
   transaction. The relationship between the request and
   transaction is defined as follow:
     * non-CANCEL/non-ACK requests - if the request belongs to a
       transaction (it's a retransmision), the function will do a
       standard processing of the retransmission and will
       break/stop the script. The function return false if the
       request is not a retransmission.
     * CANCEL request - true if the cancelled INVITE transaction
       exists.
     * ACK request - true if the ACK is a local end-to-end ACK
       corresponding to an previous INVITE transaction.

   This function can be used from REQUEST_ROUTE and BRANCH_ROUTE.

   Example 1.27. t_check_trans usage
...
if ( is_method("CANCEL") ) {
        if ( t_check_trans() )

   This function can be used from ONREPLY_ROUTE, FAILURE_ROUTE.

   Example 1.28. t_was_cancelled usage
...
if (t_was_cancelled()) {
    log("transaction was cancelled by UAC\n");
}
...

1.4.13.  t_on_failure(failure_route)

   Sets reply routing block, to which control is passed after a
   transaction completed with a negative result but before
   sending a final reply. In the referred block, you can either
   start a new branch (good for services such as
   forward_on_no_reply) or send a final reply on your own (good
   for example for message silo, which received a negative reply
   from upstream and wants to tell upstream "202 I will take care
   of it").

   As not all functions are available from failure route, please
   check the documentation for each function to see the
   permissions. Any other commands may result in unpredictable
   behavior and possible server failure.

   Only one failure_route can be armed for a request. If you use
   many times t_on_failure(), only the last one has effect.

   Note that whenever failure_route is entered, RURI is set to
   value of the winning branch.

   Meaning of the parameters is as follows:
     * failure_route - Reply route block to be called.

   This function can be used from REQUEST_ROUTE, BRANCH_ROUTE,
   ONREPLY_ROUTE and FAILURE_ROUTE.

   Example 1.29. t_on_failure usage
...
route {
        t_on_failure("1");
        t_relay();
}

failure_route[1] {
        seturi("sip:user@voicemail");
        append_branch();
        t_relay();
}
...

1.4.14.  t_on_reply(reply_route)

   Sets reply routing block, to which control is passed each time
   a reply (provisional or final) for the transaction is
   received. The route is not called for local generated replies!
   In the referred block, you can inspect the reply and perform
   text operations on it.

   As not all functions are available from this type of route,
   please check the documentation for each function to see the
   permissions. Any other commands may result in unpredictable
   behavior and possible server failure.

   Only one onreply_route can be armed for a request. If you use
   many times t_on_reply(), only the last one has effect.

   If the processed reply is provisionla reply (1xx code), by
   calling the drop() function (exported by core), the execution
   of the route will end and the reply will not be forwarded
   further.

   Meaning of the parameters is as follows:
     * reply_route - Reply route block to be called.

   This function can be used from REQUEST_ROUTE, BRANCH_ROUTE,
   ONREPLY_ROUTE and FAILURE_ROUTE.

   Example 1.30. t_on_reply usage
...
route {
        t_on_reply("1");
        t_relay();
}

onreply_route[1] {
        if (t_check_status("1[0-9][0-9]")) {
                setflag(1);
                log("provisional reply received\n");
                if (t_check_status("183"))
                        drop;
        }
}
...

1.4.15.  t_on_branch(branch_route)

   Sets a branch route to be execute separately for each branch
   of the transaction before being sent out - changes in that
   route should reflect only on that branch.

   As not all functions are available from this type of route,
   please check the documentation for each function to see the
   permissions. Any other commands may result in unpredictable
   behavior and possible server failure.

   Only one branch_route can be armed for a request. If you use
   many time t_on_branch(), only the last one has effect.

   By calling the drop() function (exported by core), the
   execution of the branch route will end and the branch will not
   be forwarded further.

   Meaning of the parameters is as follows:
     * branch_route - Branch route block to be called.

   This function can be used from REQUEST_ROUTE, BRANCH_ROUTE,
   ONREPLY_ROUTE and FAILURE_ROUTE.

   Example 1.31. t_on_branch usage
...
route {
        t_on_branch("1");
        t_relay();
}

branch_route[1] {
        if (uri=~"bad_uri") {
                xlog("dropping branch $ru \n");
                drop;
        }
        if (uri=~"GW_uri") {
                append_rpid();
        }
}
