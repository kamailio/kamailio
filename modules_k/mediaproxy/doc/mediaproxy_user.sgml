	<title>Overview</title>
		<para>
			Mediaproxy is a &ser; module that is designed to allow automatic 
			NAT traversal for the majority of existing SIP clients. This means 
			that there will be no need to configure anything in particular on 
			the NAT box to allow these clients to work behind NAT when using 
			the mediaproxy module.
		</para>
	</section>
	
	<section>
	<title>Principle of operation</title>
		<para>
			This NAT traversal solution operates by placing a mediaproxy server 
			in the middle between 2 SIP user-agents. It mangles the SDP 
			messages for both of them in a way that will make the parties talk 
			with mediaproxy while they think they talk directly with each other.
		</para>
		<para>
			To achieve this, mediaproxy is actually composed by 2 components:
			<itemizedlist>
				<listitem><para>
					the &ser; mediaproxy module itself
				</para></listitem>
				<listitem><para>
					an external proxy server called &ser; MediaProxy 
					(available from http://mediaproxy.ag-projects.com/ )
				</para></listitem>
			</itemizedlist>
		</para>
		<para>
			To avoid confusion in this document the mediaproxy module will be 
			called 'module' or 'mediaproxy module', while the mediaproxy server 
			will be called 'proxy server' from here on.
		</para>
		<para>
			The proxy server can be run on the same machine as the module or on 
			a remote host. Moreover it is possible for a single module to 
			control multiple proxy servers running on multiple geographically 
			distributed hosts. To find out more about the architecture 
			of &ser; MediaProxy please read the documentation that comes with it.
		</para>
		<para>
			To be able to act as a proxy between the 2 talking parties, the 
			machine(s) running the module/proxy server must have a public IP 
			address.
		</para>
		<para>
			The module will ask the proxy server to allocate as many sockets as there
			are media streams in the SDP body of the SIP INVITE/Ok messages. The proxy
			server will send back to the module the address and port(s) for them. Then
			the module will replace the original contact IP and RTP ports from the SDP
			messages with the ones provided by the proxy server. By doing this both
			clients will try to contact the proxy server instead of talking directly
			with each other. Once the clients contact the proxy server, it will record
			the addresses they came from and will know where to forward packets received
			from the other party This is needed because the address/port the NAT box
			will allocate for the leaving streams is not known before they actually
			leave the NAT box. However the address of the proxy server is always known
			(being a public one) so the 2 parties know where to connect and then after
			they did so, the proxy learns the addresses they came from and can forward
			packets between them.
		</para>

	<section>
	<title>Types of SIP clients</title>			
		<para>
			The SIP clients that will work transparently behind NAT when using the
			mediaproxy module are the so-called symmetric clients. The symmetric clients
			have the particularity that use the same port to send the data as the one
			they use to receive it. In other words, if they are for example configured
			to use port 5060 for SIP signaling, they will use the same port when sending
			data as well as when receiving it. This must be true for both the SIP
			signaling as well as the RTP streams for a client to work transparently with
			the mediaproxy module without any additional configuration on the NAT box.
		</para>
		<para>
			This ability is important because the only way to get back to a client
			behind NAT is to send to the IP address and port the packet was received
			from. Once a packet is sent from the client behind NAT to the outside world,
			it opens a communication channel in the NAT box that is open in both
			directions for a while (it will timeout after a while after no more data is
			sent through it, but it can be kept active by sending data through it at
			certain regular time intervals). While this channel is open, any data sent
			to the public address and port that the NAT box assigned for the address and
			port the client behind NAT is sending from (and this mapping is guaranteed
			to be unique), will go back straight to the address and port the client has
			sent from. This is why is necessary for the clients to be symmetric. If they
			listen on the same port they sent from, the data sent back to the public
			address that the NAT box assigned to the leaving packets will actually reach
			the listening port of the client behind NAT.
		</para>
		<para>
			Some SIP clients implement particular algorithms to detect if they are
			actually behind a NAT box and try to act smart by detecting the IP address
			of the NAT box (or simply allowing one to manually configure it), and then
			use this IP address in the SIP and SDP messages instead of their own private
			IP address. This situation can be confusing for a module that tries to
			perform transparent NAT traversal as it can wrongly mistake such a client
			that is behind NAT with a client that is actually in the public address
			space. However for the mediaproxy module it is not important if the clients
			apply or not this kind of behavior, as it is able to cope with both
			situations gracefully.
		</para>
		<para>
			This doesn't mean that mediaproxy is not able to work with asymmetric
			clients behind NAT, but in their case special static forwarding routes need
			to be configured on the NAT box.
		</para>
		<para>
			Mediaproxy has special support for asymmetric clients, can detect them and
			send the data to the ports they expect it to, however they can work behind
			NAT only if static routes are configured on the NAT box since there is no
			way of getting back to an address/port that has not previously opened a data
			channel in the NAT box by sending something out first. Nevertheless the
			support for asymmetric clients is important, because without it they won't
			be able to work even when they have public Internet addresses. Also this
			support allows one to use an asymmetric client behind NAT if he can
			configure the NAT box to forward the packets meant to that client.
		</para>
		<para>
			The only requirement a symmetric SIP client must met to be able to work
			transparently behind NAT when using the mediaproxy module is to accept to be
			configured to use a so called outbound proxy and this proxy must be the one
			running with the mediaproxy module loaded.

	<title>Comparison with the nathelper module</title>
		<para>
			After reading all this you may wonder what this module can offer you that
			the nathelper module (a similar nat traversal solution) can't and why was
			necessary to develop this module.
		</para>
		<para>
			While at surface they seem to offer about the same functionality, there are
			a few core differences that make them quite different.
		</para>
		<para>
			The main and most notable difference is that mediaproxy offers a
			distributed environment, where the mediaproxy module can control multiple
			mediaproxy servers. The mediaproxy servers can be local or remote and they
			can be specified per domain or as defaults for domains that don't have their
			own mediaproxy servers defined. These mediaproxy servers can be arranged in
			load balancing and fallback schemes allowing the platform to scale up easily
			and also offer redundancy to keep the service running even if some of the
			mediaproxies go offline. Mediaproxy is able to detect the dead proxies and
			redistribute the calls among the other mediaproxies that are available.
			(More details about this can be found in the &ser; MediaProxy documentation.)
		</para>
		<para>
			Another important difference is that mediaproxy tries to move the complex
			logic of decision from the &ser; configuration file to the module and the
			proxy servers themselves. This is why there are very few functions in this
			module that take any parameters. Instead, control is achieved by modifying
			resources outside of openser.cfg. This includes for example specifying the
			mediaproxy servers using DNS SRV records, or declaring asymmetric clients
			in external files that are automatically re-read as soon as they change.
			This allows &ser; to run without interruption or restarts. If one wants to
			change &ser;'s behavior, instead of changing openser.cfg and restarting &ser;, one
			will change these external resources and &ser; will adapt it's behavior on the
			fly without any need for restart.
		</para>
		<para>
			Another advantage of this is that openser.cfg becomes simpler and easier to
			maintain.
		</para>

	<title>How to use sip_ping from the nathelper module</title>
		<para>
			The nathelper module provides an option to ping with real SIP messages 
			instead of just sending 4 zero bytes, which has the advantage that 
			the communication is bidirectional and thus some NATs that only keep
			the connection open if there is traffic from the inside won't close 
			the pinholes (the 4 zero byte ping doesn't have a reply from inside 
			the NAT).
		</para>
		<example>
		<title>Pinging exmaple configuration</title>
				<programlisting format="linespecific">
...
loadmodule "/lib/openser/modules/mediaproxy.so"
