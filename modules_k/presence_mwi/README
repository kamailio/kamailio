Chapter 1. Admin Guide

1.1. Overview

   The module does specific handling for notify-subscribe
   message-summary (message waiting indication) events as
   specified in RFC 3842. It is used with the general event
   handling module, presence. It constructs and adds
   message-summary event to it.

   The module does not currently implement any authorization
   rules. It assumes that publish requests are only issued by a
   voicemail application and subscribe requests only by the owner
   of voicemail box. Authorization can thus be easily done by
   Kamailio configuration file before calling handle_publish()
   and handle_subscribe() functions.

   The module implements a simple check of content type
   application/simple-message-summary: Content must start with
   Messages-Waiting status line followed by zero or more lines
   that consist of tabs and printable ASCII characters.
