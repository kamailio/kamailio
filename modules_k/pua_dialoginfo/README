Chapter 1. Admin Guide

1.1. Overview

   The pua_dialoginfo retrieves dialog state information from the
   dialog module and PUBLISHes the dialog-information using the
   pua module. Thus, in combination with the presence_xml module
   this can be used to derive dialog-info from the dialog module
   and NOTIFY the subscribed watchers about dialog-info changes.
   This can be used for example with SNOM and Linksys phones.

   Note: This implements dialog-info according to RFC 4235 and is
   not compatible with the BLA feature defined in
   draft-anil-sipping-bla-03.txt. (Actually the BLA draft is
   really crap as it changes SIP semantics)

   The module is based on code (copy/paste) from pua_usrloc and
   nat_traversal module.

   Following you will show some examples of an dialog-info XML
   document taken from RFC 4235. This will help you to understand
   the meaning of the module parameters:

<?xml version="1.0"?>
<dialog-info xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:dialog-info"
             version="1"
             state="full"
             entity="sip:alice@example.com">
    <dialog id="as7d900as8"
            call-id="a84b4c76e66710"
            local-tag="1928301774"
            remote-tag="456887766"
            direction="initiator">
        <state>early</state>
    </dialog>
</dialog-info>

   The root element is the "dialog-info". It contains the
   namespace, the version (which must be incremented for each new
   PUBLISH for this certain dialog), the state (this module only
   supports state=full) and the entity for which we publish the
   dialog-info.

   The "dialog" element must contain an id parameter. The id
   parameter is usually different to the optional call-id
   parameter (which is the call-id of the INVITE request) as an
   INVITE can create multiple dialogs (forked request). But as
   the dialog module does not support multiple dialogs created by
   a single transaction, the pua_dialoginfo module sets the id
   parameter to the same value as the call-id parameter. The
   "local-tag" indicates the local tag of the entity. The
   remote-tag indicates the tag of the remote party. The
   "direction" indicates if the entity was the initator of the
   dialog or the recepient (aka if the entity sent or received
   the first INVITE).

   The "state" element describes the state of the dialog state
   machine and must be either: trying, proceeding, early,
   confirmed or terminated.

   The dialog element can contain optional "local" and "remote"
   elements which decsribes the local and the remote party in
   more detail, for example:

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<dialog-info xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:dialog-info"
             version="1" state="full">
    <dialog id="as7d900as8"
            call-id="a84b4c76e66710"
            local-tag="1928301774"
            remote-tag="456887766"
            direction="initiator">
        <state>early</state>
        <local>
            <identity display="Alice">sip:alice@example.com</identity>
            <target uri="sip:alice@phone11.example.com"/>
        </local>
        <remote>
            <identity display="Bob">sip:bob@example.org</identity>
            <target uri="sip:bobster@phone21.example.org"/>
        </remote>
    </dialog>
</dialog-info>

   The local and remote elements are needed to implement call
   pickup. For example if the above XML document is received by
   somebody who SUBSCRIBEd the dialog-info of Alice, then it can
   pick-up the call by sending an INVITE to Bob (actually I am
   not sure if it should use the URI in the identity element or
   the URI in the target parameter) which contains a Replaces
   header which contains the call-id and the tags. This was
   tested sucessfully with Linksys SPA962 phones and with SNOM
   320 Firmware 7.3.7 (you have to set the function key to
   "Extension").

   A dialog-info XML document may contain multiple "dialog"
   elements, for example if the entity has multiple ongoing
   dialogs. For example the following XML document shows a
   confirmed dialog and an early (probably a second incoming
   call) dialog.

<?xml version="1.0"?>
<dialog-info xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:dialog-info"
             version="3"
             state="full"
             entity="sip:alice@example.com">
    <dialog id="as7d900as8" call-id="a84b4c76e66710"
            local-tag="1928301774" remote-tag="hh76a"
            direction="initiator">
        <state>confirmed</state>
    </dialog>
    <dialog id="j7zgt54" call-id="ASDRRVASDRF"
            local-tag="123456789" remote-tag="EE345"
            direction="recipient">
        <state>early</state>
    </dialog>
</dialog-info>

   As the dialog module callbacks only address a certain dialog,
   the pua_dialoginfo always PUBLISHes XML documents with a
   single "dialog" element. If an entity has multiple concurrent
   dialogs, the pua_dialoginfo module will send PUBLISH for each
   dialog. These multiple "presenties" can be aggregated by the
   presence_dialoginfo module into a single XML document with
   multiple "dialog" elements. Please see the description of the
   presence_dialoginfo module for details about the aggregation.

   If there are problems with the callbacks from dialog module
   and you want to debug them you define PUA_DIALOGINFO_DEBUG in
   pua_dialoginfo.c and recompile.

   Known issues:
     * The module tries to find out if the entity is a local
       user. Only PUBLISH to local user are sent. Therefore, the
       module needs to find out if the domain is a local one or
       not. It uses the same mechanism as the "==myself"
       mechanism. Thus, all domains have to be declared with the
       "alias=..." option in Kamailio.cfg. DB-based multidomain
       support as offered by "domain" module is not supported
       yet. Conclusion: The module has the same "domain" problems
       as the "rr" module.
     * The module puts the call-id of the dialog into an XML
       parameter. Thus, if the call-id contains quotes, they
       should be escaped. This is not yet implemented. Thus, if
       the call-id contains quotes the XML document will be
       invalid.
     * The module derives the AoR of the callee from the To:
       header. Thus, if the To header does not contain the
       canonical AoR the PUBLISH might have the wrong SIP URI in
       the RURI and the entity parameter.

1.2. Dependencies

1.2.1. Kamailio Modules

   The following modules must be loaded before this module:
     * dialog.
     * pua.

1.2.2. External Libraries or Applications

   The following libraries or applications must be installed
   before running Kamailio with this module loaded:
     * libxml.

1.3. Exported Parameters

1.3.1. include_callid (int)

   If this parameter is set, the optional call-id will be put
   into the dialog element. This is needed for call-pickup
   features.

   Default value is "1".

   Example 1.1. Set include_callid parameter
...
modparam("pua_dialoginfo", "include_callid", 0)
...

1.3.2. include_tags (int)

   If this parameter is set, the local and remote tag will be put
   into the dialog element. This is needed for call-pickup
   features.

   Default value is "1".

   Example 1.2. Set include_tags parameter
...
modparam("pua_dialoginfo", "include_tags", 0)
...

1.3.3. include_localremote (int)

   If this parameter is set, the optional local and remote
   elements will be put into the dialog element. This is needed
   for call-pickup features.

   Default value is "1".

   Example 1.3. Set include_localremote parameter
...
modparam("pua_dialoginfo", "include_localremote", 0)
...

1.3.4. initial_lifetime (int)

   The PUBLISH requests used to send the dialog-info contain an
   Expires header. If the PUBLISH requests sends a "confirmed"
   dialog-info it sets the Expires header to the value of the
   dialog-lifetime (configure option of the dialog module). For
   "trying" and "early", the Expires header is set to the value
   of this parameter. Thus, this parameter should be a few
   seconds more than the fr_inv_timer of the tm module.

   Default value is "125".

   Example 1.4. Set initial_lifetime parameter
...
modparam("pua_dialoginfo", "initial_lifetime", 300)
...

1.3.5. caller_confirmed (int)

   Usually the dialog-info of the caller will be "trying -> early
   -> confirmed" and the dialog-info of the callee will be "early
   -> confirmed". On some phones the function LED will start
   blinking if the state is early, regardless if is is the caller
   or the callee (indicated with the "direction" parameter). To
   avoid blinking LEDs for the caller, you can enable this
   parameter. Then the state of the caller will be singaled as
   "confirmed" even in "early" state. This is a workaround for
   the buggy Linksys SPA962 phones. SNOM phones work well with
   the default setting.

   Default value is "0".

   Example 1.5. Set caller_confirmed parameter
...
modparam("pua_dialoginfo", "caller_confirmed", 1)
...
